30 June 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and Martin Ferrer

DATE : 30 June at 1100 hours

1. Upon Erneido Oliva's request, AMBIDDY-1 went to meet with him last night. At the meeting Oliva mentioned to A-1 that he (Oliva) was receiving the backing of KUBARK and the Pentagon and implied A-1 was also receiving aid. Oliva stated that he has met with Alfredo Rodemeyer, the same Rodemeyer that both of them had met early last year. A-1 replied this was all before the death of Kennedy and he no longer had contact with any of ODYOKE's officials. According to Oliva, Mr. Rodemeyer spoke badly of some of the personnel in A-l's organization, e.g., Antonio Iglesias. Oliva mentioned that he had talked with Thomas Mann recently and expected to seu Mr. Mann within the coming week to receive support for his conventional warfare program. A-1 told Oliva he had no objection to the conventional warfare plan and that he would morally support Oliva in liberating Cuba. However, he would continue in his own little way with his unconventional war. According to A-1, he made it clear to Oliva that he was not receiving ODYOKE backing.

2. A-1 expects to leave on 1 July for Costa Pica tomorrow. He again mentioned that Adelaide will soon be leaving the United States. A-1 commented he does not expect to visit the United States as often as he has done in the past. A-1 asked that Enrique and Mr. Archer clearly under-stand that he does intend to keep his word concerning the changes he has mentioned to us at the last two meetings.

AMWORLD'S MEETING IN NEW ORLEANS, 24 June 1964

SUBJECT: ANBIDDY-1's Image and Philosophy

1. ANBIDDY-1's prenccupation with his political image shene thru, shen he inquired whether we suspected him of dictatorial loanings. We replied, in effect, that we ontertained such suspicions and inclined toward taking his protestetions of liberalien and laisses faire with a heavy dose of salt. Once in power, he would treat the 1940 as a scrap of paper and run the country along autoritorian lines. Flattered by his implied inclusion in the line of succession, A-l caly voiced mild dissent.

2. Comment: Considering the exigencies of autonomy which dany us much opportunity, let alone leverage in shaping AMBIDOT-1's political philosophy, we have conveyed to him in a variety of ways that we do not particularly care one way or the other, that we do not fancy him as a abesen instrument outside the periphery of AORLD and that by extension we have no intention of promoting any political aspirations he may barbor. We have also left no doubt in his mind that we view his perfarnance in the ANWORLD driver's seat rather than any philosophical streams of consciousness, as a dependable gauge of how he would be performing in a position of political responsibility.

We pointed out to ANTIDDY-1 that Liberation Day would find a prestrats, bankrupt and exhausted people, weary to death e politics and propaganda, eraving to be left alens for a stále te eelises ite thoughte. There would be ne political infree. structure on which to build and promaturely called general elections 'vould merely serve to deluce the currency of parliamentary dome eracy even more. For a velle at least, a benign and just exscutibl vould have to restore Cuba's equilibrium and permit her te rebuild the feat ratione without which a democracy cannot properly functies.

In this context, we mentioned sentiments expressed by AMBIDDY-1 on Venezuela TV deprecating largescale revenge during the reconstruction phase and voiced hope that he would do his share to see these noble ideas put into effect.

ANWORLD MEETING IN NEW ORLEANS, 24 June 1964
SUBJECT: Adlaida PADRON y Crus - Decision to Nove Her to Nicaragua

1.  Drawing liberally upon data supplied in UPGA 16512, we reminded AMBIDDY-1 about our misgivings regarding his association with Adelaida PADRON y Cruz. He conceded awareness of some of the rumors circulating about her past private life and stated that he had satisfied himself that they were unfounded. We injected that we knew that Jose Mole Rosales has been asked to do some investigating and had given Adelaida Padron a clean bill of health. We also happened to know that KXI was aware of the true story and for reasons of his own had decided to withhold it from ANBIDDY-1. we inquired what he know about Senora MOLI and he commented that she had been a "bad women". We observed that the "had been" was open to question.

2.  ANBIDDY-1 averred that he had listened to a telephone conversation betoon Adelaida and ber forner husband, Roger Bejas Lavernis, in which the latter had admitted that the story about his having acted under higher orders when marrying Adelaida vere cafounded. ANBIDDY-l also charged the ex-husband of having tried to ustice his wife to participato in ergies, but that Adelaida hed refused to do so.

3.  As regards Adelaida's alleged illicit relationship with ex-President BATISTA, AMBIDDY-1 simply declared the charge to be unfounded. Adelaida did know Carlos CANTILLO Gonzales the wo an old fried of the family. She also had met ex-Presi-dat Jum, but nothing of a compromising nature had ensued.

4.  When asked whether te me tous thes Advlatda bad intro-deed him to several prominent Venesusians, he denied this and stated that introdestions had been made by silvia GARCIA, a Brusted childhood friend of ANBIDDY-1


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 6

-2-

5. Our query why Adelaida, if she had AMBIDDY-1's interests at heart, appeared to have qualms about owning up in respect to past events, was parried by AMBIDDY-1 by claiming that Adelaida was of course aware of all these rumors and had warned him of possible political embarrassment.

6. Evaluating UFGA 16512 on the basis of our talk with AMBIDDY-1, we conclude that its main source has a high batting average. At least there appears to be a hard core of truth to practically all allegations made, to the extent we were able to check them out. We would venture the guess that, despite his protestations to the contrary, AMBIDDY-1 is quite conversant with Adelaida's past history, but can see no practical gain in so telling us. He may reason that an avowal of intent to marry a woman whose antecedents are in fact as described, would seriously blemish his image and that by pleading ignorance now he can, if things should get out of control, always strike a pose of injured innocence and elicit a "there but for the grace of God go I" reaction from his PBPRIME associates.

7. Agreement that all interested parties would benefit by moving Adelaida's abode from the WAVE area to Nicaragua was reached on the basis of AMBIDDY-1's acceptance of our flat statement that we view Adelaida as a potential hazard to AMWORLD's and KUMARK's security. He based this reasoning upon numerous incidents that Adelaida had become all but completely privy to everything that was going on in AMWORLD and that her discretion left a great deal to be desired. We drew no denial from AMBIDDY-1 when stating that Adelaida had become witting of the WAVE training course for AMBIDDY-1 and that she presumably knew about KIBARK's support for AMWORLD. We referred to Adelaida's lechian associates, without stating that we suspected her of holding charter membership mentioned by name Aida PEREZ and Lucia CARO. When the latter was labelled by us a lesbian believed to be in Adelaida's complete confidence, AMBIDDY-1 evinced surprise and for reasons difficult to fathom almost dismay. We concluded by stressing the importance of breaking up Adelaida's circle of associates and confidants as an indispensable prerequisite for containing the threat her access to information we consider classified represents and asked AMBIDDY-1 to make sure that member of this group would follow her to Nicaragua.

8. We made no attempt, which in any case would have been vain, to break up the relationship between AMBIDDY-1 and Adelaida. We apologized to him for involving ourselves in matters of a private and intimate nature which unfortunately vere beginning to impinge upon ODYOKE security interests. ANBIDOT-1 in turn made it clear that he thinks he is in love and that separation is not in the cards. We dropped the issue by assuring AMBIDDY-1 that the day would come when things could be seen in better perspective and that he could depend on *us not to gloat ce resind him that we had told him so.

9. We mentioned offhand that we assumed that Adelaida had all the papers necessary to effect her departure fron POFRIME. AMBIDDY-1 replied that she had not been able yet to get the necessary papers. We simply commented that she should ask for then.

TYPIC/AMWORLD-Identity

REFS: A. UFGA 16512, 15 June 1964
B. DIR 31528

1. Chief, WH requests that an investigation of the truth of some of the allegations made in Ref A report be held in abeyance pending determination whether Subject in fact has decided to leave *PRIME* for Nicaragua.

2. Headquarters continues to be interested in additional data regarding the house in the WAVE area which AMBIDDY-1 intends to purchase in the name of Nilo Messer.

3. If it should turn out that the conditions described in Ref report are not drastically remedied and continue to pose a festering threat to the security of AMWORLD, your station may have to be requested to investigate. In the meanwhile, we are hopeful that Subject's removal from the WAVE area will serve to attenuate this bad situation.

4. Thanks to Ref A report, we were able (without going into too such sordid detail) to put AMBIDDY-1 on notice that we view his association with Subject in the WAVE area as a potential threat to AMWORLD' and EUBARK's security and that the political scandal potential of the existing situation is equally formidable. We consequently fell in with AMBIDDY-1's suggestion, made during the latest reeting in Panama City, that he rove the center of his illicit affair to Manngua where it would be easier to contain unpleasant repercussions than in the WAVE area. We urged AMBIDDY-1, and he promised to heed our advice, that ne dot permit Subject to take along to Ficaragua members of her present entourage, singling out Identity Q of Ref A as a particular case in point.

5. It should be stressed that AMBIDDY-1 is unwavering in his (real er feigned) conviction that Subject is pure as driven snow and badly maligned and that he has a ready explanation for every "rumor." It would have been unvise to attempt coercing him into discontinuing his affair with Subject, and most likely he would not have yielded to any pressures. Hence, we had no choice but to settle for the pro- poved nove to Nicaragua which represents a palliative at best.

SUBJECT: DMJM Engineers

Sambora reported he met with AWBIDDY/1 at the Miami airport on 5 June 1964 for a brief discussion of organizational changes. After their talk, A/1 requested Sambora accompany him to the airport hotel to act as interpreter with an American engineer (possibly DMJM). Sambora did not recall the name of the engineer but that the engineer had stated the airstrip in Nicaragua would cost somewhere in the vicinity of a million dollars. According to Sambora, A/1 simply listened to the proposal and said he would take the matter under advisement.

# ANTORLD Meeting in Miani, 28 June 1964

**SUBJECT:** Photographs of Adolaida Padron

1.  During a lull in the meeting I took AMBIDDY-1 aside (as instructed) and told his it would be best for all concerned to take Adelaida out of POPRINE as he had suggested. I mentioned to him there is a growing number of reports en Adelaida finding their way to Vashington, making it increasingly difficult for us to protect his rear.

2.  I then casually mentioned to him that we had received some obscene photographs which have caused us to do acse fast talking with "some people in Washington" that are beginning to have some sisgivings about AKRIDOT-1 (actually this story is notional).

3.  I noticed the remark concerning the photographs uport ANBIDDY-1. "Do you mean immoral pictures, Martin?" AMRIDDY-1 inquired. I nodded and to avoid his asking further questions about the pictures, I reminded him of his precise that Lucia Cano, Natacha d'Angelo (AMBIDDY-1 denied knowing her) and Aida Perez Pono would not follow Adelaida to Nicaragua.

4.  During the rest of the meeting ANBIDDY-1 appeared to be somewhat dejected and preoccupied. It is the opinion of the Co's attending the meeting that this was attributed to the rezarks made concerning the existence of these photographs

5.  As the meeting was about to end, ANBIDDY-1 asked

her (Acolaida), Martin?" Again I said "Yes." These photographs had come into our possession plus much more

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

information that we had not divulged to him. AMBIDDY-1
then inquired if he could see the photographs. I replied
that it was our feeling that it would serve no useful
purpose other than to satisfy his own curiosity. Inasmuch
as he had promised to take Adelaide out of the country,
there was no sense in rubbing salt into the wound. Further-
more, we did not wish to reveal our sources to AMBIDDY-1.
Lastly, both he and I know that photographs could be
fabricated and we did not want to be falsely accused of
doing just this. AMBIDDY-1 again asked that I inform
BECKHOFF that he is interested in seeing the pictures.
In order to drop the entire subject, I promised AMBIDDY-1
I would pass the message to BECKHOFF.

6. BECKHOFF believes that this (notional) intervention
   jarred ANBIDDY-1 out of his complacent assumption that we
   lack substantial information to back up our claim that
   Adelaida's immoralities are more than unprovable rumors.
   Also, hopefully, he may now have been put on guard and
   say take adequate precautions against blackmail of himself
   or Adelaida which we consider a major threat to the security
   of ANWORLD. If in future meetinga AMBIDDY-1 should revert
   to the existence of these photographs, it may be best to
   state that they were promptly destroyed but that their also
   being in the possession of potential blackmailers can never
   be ruled out. ANBIDDY-1 should be reminded of his assurance
   to alert us immediately if such blackmail attempts are made
   since he may need our help in varding them off. He has
   our assurance that we would not use the cropping up of
   such difficulties to remind him of his failure to heed our
   waraings.

ANWORLD Meeting in New Orleans, 24 June 1964

SUBJECT: ANYUM-19 or Nice Guys Finish last

1. HQS conclusion that AMWORLD interests would best be
   served by not opposing the termination of liaison contacts
   with ANYUM-19 was prompted by some of the following con-
   siderations:

a. AMBIDDY-l's obvious displeasure with the existing
relationship, as evidenced by his rather pointed ob-
servations about the corrupting effects of such contacts
on subordinate levels. The fact that such contacts provide
KUBARK with a certain insight into those AMWORLD affairs
which AMBIDDY-1 prefers to keep secret is obviously a
factor, but not an overriding one, What really worries
AMBIDDY-1 is--he claims--that factionalism draws suste-
nance from working level liaison between Cubans and
Americans except in those rare instances whore the
loyalty of the Cuban representative is beyond cavil.

b. AMBIDDY-1's lack of confidence in ANYUM-19's
loyalty. HQS position has been all along that AMBIDDY-1
is the sole judge of who among his co-workera merit
trust and who doesn't. To dispute his judgment would
entangle KUBARK into intra-AMWORLD power politics with
no adequate basis for htelligent judant. Either we
reserve ourselves the right of co-determination on all
persoanel action or on none. ANWORLD groundrules are
unambiguoan on that score. We do not become involved
except in those instances where our opinions are
specifically elicited, as in the field of background
checks which only by inference bear upon the issue of
loyalty to AMBIDDY-1. In sum, once AMBIDDY-1 withdraws
his confidence from a co-worker we have no log to stand
on in persisting that we have the right to consider that
particular individual cur chosen instrument in the field
of liaison.

4. ANTUM-19's dual role as a ranking functionary
   of AMWORLD and the Number Two Man in AMTUM. Since we
   have reason for believing that a dichotomy has been
   opening up between AMWORLD and AMYUN's old guard (to

SECRET
![des'sseitigation]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 23

-2-

which AMYUM-19 belongs), liaison with AMWORLD conducted through AMYUM-19 ipso facto involves KUBARK in factional strife. We recall that some of the major troubles be- setting the action mechanism prior Playa Giron stemmed from the interference of political commissars. Without derogating from the importance of the ideological component in the struggle against ANTHUO, in any showdown between the military command and the political functionary corps, it behooves us to range KUBARK alongside the former unless the points at issue manifestly implicate PBPRIME security. Under AMWORLD groundrules KUBARK supports AMBIDDY-1 as the commander of an unconventional warfare instrument, not an exile organization, let alone the ideology and aspirations which animate it.

d. The ANYUM opposition group represented by ANDUM-18 clearly desires a share in the decision-making processes which KUBARK has entrusted to AMBIDDY-1. While they pay lip service to the principle of non-interference in purely military affairs, in the final analysis it would be impossible to keep the two aspects apart. Any con- cessions on KUBARK's part to the pretensions of the ANTUM opposition would confront KUBARK with intangibles in the form of occult pressures brought to bear upon AMBIDDY-1 whose impact we could not possibly gauge or control.

e. ANTUM dissidence flourishes in the WAVE area, whereas ANWORLD's center of gravity rests in Central America. Unless AMBIDDY-1's stewardship is unimpeded by ANYUN factionalism, AMWORLD's performance is bound to suffer since AMBIDDY-1's preoccupations will always retain e focus on his WAVE area backyard..

f. The impression that ANWORLD may be disintegrating is fed by intel which essentially reflects WAVE area backstage maneuverings in the political sphere, not the situation in the campe about which we are, as a matter ef fact, relatively uninformed. By striving to insulate AMWORLD against the vagaries of WAVE area bickering and strife, the ANWORLD poture is bound to move into clearer foous and any shortcomings for which AMBIDDY-1 should be called to aggount can no longer be blamed upon the debilitating effects of AMYUM intrigue and-most important-- cannot possibly be blamed upon KUBARK once its links with ANTUM-18 have been severed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

g. An emasculated political apparatus in the WAVE area will deprive AMBIDDY-1 of all excuse to divide his time between Central America (where he belongs) and the WAVE area.

h. The tawdry aftermath of the ZENON II raid can justly be blamed if not on AMYUM, at least on AMBIDDY-1's political representation in the WAVE area. With that representation effectively eliminated, one of the main sources of ODYOKE discomfiture will have been effectively dislocated. Impending changes should at least eliminate the AMYUM press and intel sections.

i. Should there be further unpleasantness in the WAVE area, KUBARK will, once contacts with AMYUM-19 have ceased, have a base for plausible denial of responsibility for not preventing it.

j. If we are to believe certain not altogether unbiased reports, AMBIDDY-1, through his mistress Adelaida PADRON, has become linked with the exile demi-monde which moves on the fringes of common crime and which is closely intertwined with the remnents of Batista's regine. While AMYUM, and particularly AMYUM-19, may to some extent serve to counteract and slow down these trends, they are obviously unable to halt them entirely. Hence, what little benefit we could have derived from a tie-in between AMYUM and ANWORLD has not been forthcoming... Short of an enduring political compromise between con flicting viewpoints, which we don't consider within the realm of practical politics, any solution which keeps AMBIDDY-1 out of the WAVE area and close to his command post, serves ANWORLD and hence KUBARK interests.

k. ANWORLD in WAVE area had become a breeding ground for rumors and beyond reasonable doubt a valuable source of classified information for AMTHUG's agents. By placing ANBIDDY-1 and his pals out of reach, PBRUMEN
1.  B. may be forced to base a major collection effort en Nicaragua which won't be easy.

2. AMYUM-16 is a "nice guy," personally prepossessing and basically honorabie. He evidently and in fuli measure shares PBRIKEN propensity for political intrigue and fractionalization. He is intensely preoccupied with ideological issues and is unwilling to accept the absolute primacy of overthrowing ANTHUG to which, at least at this rather hopeless stage of the

struggle, most ideological reservations ought be subordinated. Regarding this fundamental issue he and KUBARK may be at odds. In serving as our principal working level liaison contact, he has not resisted the temptation to try parlaying it into political power vis-a-vis AMEIDDY-1, a fact that has obviously not escaped AMBIDDY-1's notice. Without impugning AMYUM-19's good faith, we have reason for believing that on occasion he has conveyed our views in the garb of KUBARK criticism of AMBIDDY-1's capabilities, e.g., as a paramilitary planner and, it appears, has left AMBIDDY-1 with the completely erroneous impression that we were taking sides in the factional dispute involving AMYUM, in essence backing AMYUM-19 against AMBIDDY-1. In advising AMBIDDY-1 on the pros and cons of dismissing SAMBORA (P), ANTEL-19 told AMBIDDY-1 that dismissal would in all probability spell a break with KUBARK which he must have known and of which he was subsequently reminded, ran completely counter to KUBARK's oft stated position that personnel matters are in AMBIDDY-1's hands. By implication, at least, he may have reinforced ANBIDDY-1's suspicions that RAMBORA was linked with KUBARK. Apparently AMBIDDY-1 has not been unduly influenced by ANYUN 19's continuous harping on the threat posed by AMBANG-1 (Ah UP-19 was never shaken in his conviction that AMBANG-1 receives KUBARK support). Another bete noire has now reared its ugly head ir: the person of Oliva.

3. ANTUM-19'a ideological preoccupations have seriously detracted from his performance as a liaison contact. As a de facto penetration of AMYUN and as a source of personality information he has done well by KUBARK. Thanks to him KUBARK undoubtedly now has a much clearer understanding of the interlock between AMBORLD and AMYUM, although we shall have to observe the course of events before accepting AMYUM-19's premise that they are Siamese twins who if surgically separated will hemorrhage to death. We owe him a debt of gratitude to have alerted us to the impending rift and to have enabled us to arrive at the only possible decision, 1.0., to throw the full weight of EUBARK's support behind ANBIDDY-1. Through hin ve have also learned a great deal bout AMBIDDY-1's calient characteristics as a leader, of course making duo allowance for a subtle injection of AMYUM-19's venon. In fairness to ANBIDDY-1 it should be stated that some of the charactoristion to which ANTUM-10 taken most violent exception, even if they are ingrainod, have been inculcated into ANBIDDY-1 by KUBARK. Bince the inceptior of the program, we have urged AMBIDDY-1 to place himself is unchallengeable control of the paramilitary apparatus and not allow political considerations to intrude ugos, the conduct of ANDORLD affairs. Any mismanagement

therefore ought not be blamed upon authoritarianism (without which AMWORLD cannot conceivably prosper) but upon a leadership gap in AMBIDDY-1's personality makeup which even "democratic centralism" couldn't correct or cure.

4. In assessing the prospective consequences of a cessation of contact between AMYUM-19 and KUBARK, we shall have to take into account that he is fully cognizant of the fact that KUBARK supports AMWORLD. The relationship that has existed heretofore is known to him in all its facets.

a. Under assumed names, the following KUBARK reps are known to him:

Bobbie Hernandex Desmond FitzGerald
Raul Hernandez Henry Hecksher
Carl Jenkins Richard Beal
Jarl Rohrer James Smith

b. ANYUM-19 has intimate knowledge of AMWORLD funding arrangements, i.e., amounts, identity of bank accounts both Swiss and New York, and related information. Unless we receive unmistakeable indications that AMYUM-19 in on the warpath against AMWORLD and KUBARK, a change in these arrangements does not appear indicated. Nor can we see any merit in dismantling AMWORLD's logistic infrastructure of which AMYUM-19 has full knowledge.

c. He knows the following individuals and may suspect that they are somehow linked with EMBARK:

Russell H. SAMBORA (P)
Peter C. KNITTEL (P)

d. Telephone numbers which were issued to ANTUM-19 are in the process of being discontinued.

e. ANYUM-19 knows the location of the following KUBARK installations and accommodation addresses (which will be given up os changed:

Maryland safehouse.

Whether or not AMYUM-18 in an attempt to avenge imagined slights by KUBARK (such as the abrupt termination of the existing relationship without farewell) by divulging

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 27

what he knows to unauthorised persons, is difficult to assay. Should he in honest conviction reach the conclusion that he was shunted aside because KUBARK considered him an obstacle to establishing full sway over AMWORLD, he could easily rationalize a betrayal. Other "ideological" considerations could be adduced by him to justify actively opposing KUBARK. Whatever he may do along those lines would not be through inadvertence but by design. We have wighed and discarded the possibility of neutralising him through recruitment. This would not work if our reading of his personality is correct. We can think of a number of deterrents, out of KUBARK's reach, which will probably make his think twice before throwing down the gauntlet. To provoke the enmity of both AMBIDDY-1 and KUBARK would be an act of defiance of which we consider AMYUM-19 incapable. Dosides. AMYUM-19 strikes us as an indivudal imbued with a sense of basic decency and of Christian morality.

6. In balance we doubt whether AMYUM-19 is going to pose a major threat to the security of AMWORLD. In any case, HQS decision to accede to AMBIDDY-l's desires on working level liaison, even if it entails a rupture in relations with AMYUM-19, vas sade in full awareness of the fact that he could cause trouble and inflict damage if this be his intent. Should this cons to pass, however, it would be unfair to shift the entire blame onte AMBIDDY-1. While we can hardly applaud the glaring lack of political acumen AMBIDDY-1 has displayed in this whole affair, while his motives in dispensing with AMYUM-19's ser- vices may not be entirely honorable, and while HOLE, his main source on the ANTUN cabal, is self serving and questionable to put it aildly, the fact remains that the final decision was KUBAR as much as it was ANBIDDY-1'8.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation Between AMBIDDY-1 and
Martin Ferrer

DATE : 22 June 1964 at 1130 hours

1. AMBIDDY-1, sounding somewhat tired and with a
   bad cold, mentioned that he would like to advance the date
   of the meeting to 23 June 1964. A-1 advised there are
   some administrative matters which have to be resolved in
   Managua and other problems in Miami that he would like
   to discuss with "Enrique". A-1 then intends to return
   to Miami.

2. In that case A-1 was notified that we (Henry and
   Martin) would hold the meeting with him on 23 June 1964
   and that Carl could talk with him and AMJAVA-4 on the
   nooning of 24 June. A-1 was advised that this is a routine
   meeting in which many items would be discussed, e.g., the
   Miami reorganization that A-l had mentioned. There was
   nothing of a critical nature.

3. The ADELAIDA arrived in Monkey Point as they
   were leaving for the States (21 June).

4. A-1 inquired if there were any outstanding
   problems. Martin evasively replied that he preferred
   not to discuss it over the phone. A-1 then asked if we
   intended to discuss A-19 and "his friends", "The under-
   signed mentioned we would be disposed to talking about
   anything which A-1 feels is important.

5. A-l stated he expects to leave for Central America
   by the end of next week.

Source's impression is that and IDEN A have closed their house to all visitors, because both are concerned about the way in which all the information about them has been leaked. One time exclaimed with fear: "the G-2 in our house!"

After source's telephone conversation with A-1, ID A called source and said: "Last night 'Tuti' could not sleep. All this gossip'is going to run him."

IDEN A told source that one time A-1 had calld her from Caracas, Venezuela, telling her that he could barely speak because he was hoarse from talking to all wealthy Venezuelans asking them to give money for the Cuban cause.

SUBJECT: AMWORLD--Possible Basis for Entente between AMBIDDY-1 and SAMBORA

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

1. We advised SAMRORA at a Washington meeting with him, 16 June 1964, that from the way things look to us he had painted himself into a corner from which he could not extricate himself. Another error was to have permitted someone like MOLE to block his path to the AMWORLD hierarchy. This in retrospect, however, is all water over the dan.

2. If SAMBORA is to perform his functions as we first com ceived then he should go to AMBIDDY-1 and arrive at a new understanding. SAMEORA was informed that we intend to meet AMBIDDY-1 before SAMBORA returns to Miami. At this meeting we intend to state in no uncertain terms that the security of the organization is in a deplorable condition. This perhaps may have the effect of placing SAMBORA in a more favorable bargaining position.

3. We counseled SAMBORA to negotiate a hard contract which would encompass at least the following terms:

a. He would not work under nor be responsible to MOLK but only to the highest echelons of AMWORLD hierarchy.

b. Full access to all files, bases, information needed to perform a professional job.

c. The complete and unhesitating support of AMBIDDY-1 in all security matters.

If Anl is unwilling to accept these terms or offers any restrictings or conditions SAMBORA has our permission to turn in his badge and bid AMBIDDY-1 a fond adieu....

SUBJECT: RYBAT/TYPIC/Operational/AMWORLD
The Private Life of AMWORLD's First Family

ACTION REQUIRED: None, FYI

REFERENCE: UFW-3514 of 6 April 1964

1. The following AMOT report concerning the not-so-private affairs of AMBIDDY/1 and his fiancee may be of interest to BECKHOFF. According to AMYUM/19, AMBIDDY/1 intends to formalize his relationship with Iden B sometime within the next few months. The marriage will probably take place in Latin America and Iden B will make her home there to avoid a public scandal which would have a harmful effect on the AMYUM organization. Attention is called to paragraphs 14, 17, and 26 which answer, in part, some of the questions raised in ref dispatch concerning ODYOKE involvement in AMWORLD. The Station has forwarded reports of this nature which concern claims by members of the Cuban exile community of KUBARK sponsorship of AMBIDDY/1. Of the specifics cited by the Cuban, intelligent or otherwise, to support their allegations those statements attributed to the AMWORLD principals themselves appear to be the only ones which can make a claim to "knowledge" as opposed to conviction based on AMWORLD's affluence. To date no tangible evidence of KUBARK involvement with AMWORLD has come to our attention.

2. Source: Iden A.

Source states that she has known AMBIDDY/1 since they were children in Esmeralda municipal term, Camaguey province, from where both of them come originally. Source further states she is also a close friend of Iden B, who is now AMBIDDY/l's mistress and a homosexual like source (according to source's statements).

3. Iden B was Fulgencio BATISTA Zaldivar's mistress in Cuba for about 8 years, and she claims her 5 year old son is BATISTA's son. Iden B met BATISTA through Carlos CANTILLO Gonzalez. When Iden B waS BATISTA's mistress she was married to Iden C, who is now in Miami also and has a very bad moral reputation. On various occasions Iden B has received money from BATISTA, always through Orlando PIEDRA Negueruela. The last money which she received, $200.00, was when she was already living with AMBIDDY/1 Iden B has many friends among MASFERRER's people and is a very close friend of the wife of Enrique MASFERRER Rojas. According to source, AMBIDDY/1 has had various meetings with Orlando PIEDRA Negueruela. Quite some time ago (source doesn't remember exact date). AMWORLD/2 raised $10,000 for AMBIDDY/1 from among "batistianos." AMWORLD/2 and Orlando PIEDRA owned a gasoline firm called "Reca", and at present AMWORLD/2 is still on very good terms with PIEDRA Negueruela.

4. Iden B used to "pose" with her sister, Iden D, to please BATISTA and in the presence and with the approval of her husband, Iden C. Iden B is a very close friend of "Flor de Loto", Tete * MACHADO, O, Aida* PEREZ Pozo, a woman called Pat (La Americana) and Natacha D'ANGELO, all known homosexuals who hold "posing" parties now in Miami like they used to in Cuba. One time when AMBIDDY/1 went to "Flor de Loto's" house he met Iden A.

5. According to source, Iden B was also the mistress of Marcos PEREZ Jimenez, former dictator of Venezuela. Iden B met PEREZ Jimenez through Colonel Pulido* BARRETO who was a friend of PEREZ Jimenez. Pulido BARRETO put Iden B in contact with an individual named PELAEZ, a narcotics trafficker according to source, who introduced her to PEREZ Jimonez. Since then Iden B lived with PEREZ Jimenez for about a year, and every time PEREZ Jimenez visited her he gave her $100.00 for the "visit".

6. Iden B was also the mistress of Pedro SUAREZ (mat. unk.), former Councilman of Marianao municipal term, Havana province.. According to source, Pedro SUAREZ was Iden B's lover here in Miami. One time Pedro SUAISZ took Iden B to see a "witch" mulatto who lives in Miami, who is also Rolando MASFERRER's "witch", according to source. Pedro SUAREZ wanted to control Iden B through this "witch", but she came to an agreement with the "witch" so that the "witch" would write a letter to BATISTA to make him send a large sum of money to her. When Pedro SUAREZ learned about this, he beat up the "witch" and denounced her to the Cuban. Refugee Center. According to source, Iden B has another lover named "Chicho' CARDENAS (mat. unk.), who is now Public Works Minister in the Republic of Panama.

7. AMBIDDY/1 talked to Iden C and asked his help in organizing the AMYUM Intelligence Section. For this objective he gave Iden C a sum of money to begin working. In the month of March or April 1963, Iden Befiled a divorce suit against her husband.

8. In the same month of March or April 1963, source received a check for $300.00 from Raul GRANDA Hernandez in behalf of AMBIDDY/1, so that Iden B could pay for her divorce. Raul GRANDA lives with Iden B's sister. Iden C was tried for having a stolen knife from a grocery store in his possession, and he was sentenced to pay a $150.00 fine.

9. Source further states that in view of the fact she (source) has many friends who like "poses", she was able to introduce to Al:BIDDY/1 some important Venezuelans including Colonel Pulido BARRETO, Carlos SISO (mat. unk.) and Osvaldo * BAJARES (Venezuelan economist). Source states that, at AMBIDDY/1's request, three meetings were held with those individuals in source's house. According to AMEIDDY/1 the objective of the meetings was to get support for his plans, and the objective of the Venezuelans was to overthrow Romulo BETANCOURT, and they were allied to the National Liberation Armed Forces (FALN). The conversations revolved around CASTRO Leon. The Venezuelans believed they could make a pact with the Communists and later eliminate them. At that time various members of FALN came to Miami (source doesn't remember when). AMBIDDY/1 assured the Venezuelans he could influence GPFOCUS and KUBARK to get support for their cause.

Carlos SISO told source he distrusted AMBIDDY/1 and believed he was a KUBARK penetration to learn all their plans. SISO also told source that when Osvaldo BAJARES returned to Venezuela he had been arrested, and SISO believed AMBIDDY/1 had denounced BAJARES. In the last meeting, SISO told source that he was going to put AMBIDDY/1 to a test. SISO asked him "whether it was true he had gone to Haiti on an official mission as an ODYOKE envoy." AMBIDDY/1 was very surprised and said he had, but insisted in SISO telling him how he had learned that. The meetings with the groups of Venezuelans stopped since that time.

After these happenings, AMBIDDY/1 informed source he had written a report to the Americans about the Venezuelan problem, and that he had treated Rafael CALDERAS very well in this report because CALDERAS had given him financial assistance.

10. AMBIDDY/1 showed source an unbound book and told her this was the most important book ODYOKE had because it contained military secrets which were known to a very few people. AMBIDDY/1 boasted of being one of the few men in the U. S., who had that document. Source leafed through the book and saw some weapons, noticing that some of those weapons were marked. AMBIDDY/1 explained that those marked weapons are the ones which AMTHUG/1 has in his possession.

11. Source further reports that on various occasions, in private conversation which AMRIDDY/1 had with Iden B, Iden and source, he said that when he seizes power in Cuba he is going to organize guerrillas to invade Mexico and other countries which have denied help to Cuba. According to source; AMBIDDY/1 is convinced he will be President and Iden B, First Lady..

When AMBIDDY/1 talks of the 1940 Constitution he says it must be defended publicly and respected as something sacred, but in private he has said that when he seizes power he is going to use every page of the Constitution as toilet paper.

12. Source heard AMBIDDY/1 talk about a book which had been published which strongly accused KUBARK, and say that he, Iden , and Iden F had furnished all the date for this book and would receive about $8,000.00 as their share of the sale profit

13. One time AMBIDDY/1, Iden B and source had a meeting and discussed who should be the pilot of his private aircraft. Iden B proposed a pilot named ALEXANDER (according to source, ALEXANDER had relations with Iden B,) but AMBIDDY/1 opposed this and complained that the PBPRIMERS forced him to select the personnel.

14. About 7 months ago (on or about Nov. 63), AMBIDDY/1 told Iden B and source that he was going to receive a secret training course under PBPRIME direction. AMBIDDY/1 used to leave every day at 6 AM and come back at night. According to source, the course lasted 6 weeks and most of the times Iden B used to drive AMBIDDY/1 in an automobile to a place in Coral Gables where the course was being given. Every time AMBIDDY/1 returned from the classes he talked about the things he had learned and talked about secret writing, codes, of some pens with a substance which could kill instantaneously, about sabotage methods, etc., etc.

15. AMBIDDY/1 frequently spends long hours at night in his house making up accounts to justify expenses.

16. After Iden B's divorce, AMBIDDY/1 moved with her to 881 NE 71st Street. AMBIDDY/1 talks constantly in the house where he lives with her about his future plans, about the single party, about the dictatorship which has to be imposed in Cuba, etc. AMBIDDY/1 often puts on a uniform, poses in front of the mirror an talks about invasion.

WAVE Comment: This is one of several recent reports concerning statements attributed to AMBIDDY/1 in which he has spoken of the need for a strongman to run Cuba. AMSHADY/1 reports that on 10 June Aurelio MARIN Naredo (one of approximately 30 AMWORLDERS recently arrived from the camps) states that AMBIDDY/1 appeared at the training camps, took a dictatorial position on a number of issues terminating with the statements to the effect that he was the only one to liberate Cuba, he was the only one to run it later, and that there would be no voting and no elections. MARIN objected, stating that he had joined a revolutionary group, hot a dictatorship, and along with other trainees requested to return to the WAVE area. According to AMSHADY/1 when the trainees arrived and went to the AMYUM offices to receive their final check AMJAVA/4 refused, a fight ensued and AMYUM/19 had to intervene. MARIN characterized AMBIDDY/1 as deceitful, liar, coward, demagogu dictator, power mad, a flagrant opportunist who cannot be trusted, etc. Realizing that AMSHADY/1 is strongly prejudiced against AMBIDDY/1 this comment is forwarded for what it is worth. AMYUM/1 has cerfirmed the incident at the AMYUM office and states that, whether or not it is justified, there is a considerable number of WORLDERS who hold similar views now and who attribute statements to AMIDDY/1 which are inconsistant with his previous public statements.

17. At the time of Provident KENNEDY' death, source asked AMBIDDY/1 whether this would barm him and he replied smiling that it did not, that now he was receiving more aid than before. AMBIDDY/1 told source that he bad received a card from Mrs. Jacqueline KENNEDY in reply to the condolences which he had sent her, and a card written by Bob KENNEDY with greetings.

18, According to source, AMBIDDY/1 has just given Iden Ba fabulous residence in Miami. According to Iden B, the residence is in the name of AMWORLD/2, but they wrote another document specifying that the house belongs to her. Iden B told source that AMBIDDY/1 had made a down payment of $8,000.00 and paid $300.00 a month, Source also reports that AMBIDDY/1 has given to AMWORLD/2


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 40

LFGA-16512

documents, valuables and jewelry which AMWORLD/2 keeps in a safety deposit box.

WAVE Comment: The Station is investigating these rumors of an alleged love nest being built for Iden B. AMYUM/19 claims that he is unaware of any validity to the rumor.

19. At present, Iden B lives with her two sons, AMBIDDY/1 and a maid named Iden G who is also a homosexual. This Iden G has brothers in Cuba who are militiamen and she corresponds with them. Iden G's husband is known as "El Gallego", and he is now in the training camps. Iden G has been a friend of Iden B for many years, and is the one who used to accompany her to her dates with BATISTA. According to source, Iden G knows too much about Iden B and is the one who really directs her.

20. Source further reports that the current AMYUM Chief of Intelligence, Iden H, is married to a woman named Iden I, who practices prostitution. AMBIDDY/1 has ordered the Intelligence Chief to collect information on Iden B, but all the reports he submits on her are good because the AMYUM Intelligence Chief is an unconditional supporter of Iden B. One time the AMYUM Intelligence Chief hit an AMYUM member because he made unfavorable comments about Iden B.

21. Source learned from Iden B that Juan AMADOR Rodriguez is one of the newspapermen in exile who receive money from AMBIDDY/1. Iden B also told source that the articles and declarations made by Iden J are written by Iden K.

22. Source further reports she learned AMBIDDY/1 had difficulties with the ERACORN brothers because Hugo *ELIAS Martinez, stationed in one of the encampments, brought contraband whiskey into Nicaragua and this angered the ERACORN brothers. Source also learned that an individual named Raul LEAL Garcia deserted from the encampments together with 21 men. This Raul LEAL is now living in marital relations with Martha BRAVO, a very close friend of Iden D.

23. Source 2: Iden L

Both Iden B and her sister Iden D are homosexuals. Iden C works at the Eden Rock in Miami Beach and lives with a Miami Beach gangster in addition to practicing prostitution. Iden M is an accountant, is registered in the Association of Cuban Accountants in Exile and works on Miami Beach.

24. According to source, Iden B was Fulgencio BATISTA Zaldivar's mistress and had a son by him. In order to avoid trouble in this affair, BATISTA married her off to Iden C, a member of the Constitutional Army with a terrible moral reputation.

Iden B used to "pose" with her sister to please her lover BATISTA and her husband. Afterwards, Iden C continued to exploit Iden B with this "posing".

When Iden B arrived in the U. S., (source does not remember date) she became the mistress of former Venezuelan President Marcow PEREZ Jimenez, and later the mistress of Pedro SUAREZ, a former Marianco Councilman. SUAREZ gave Iden B an automobile for which he made the down payment and paid some installments until he quarreled with her. AMBIDDY/1 finished paying for this automobile.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 41

25. Source further reports that Iden B had homosexual relations with Iden A (source #1). In turn, this Iden A also has homosexual relations with a known homosexual named Iden G, aka "Campeona", who lives with Iden B and AMBIDDY/1.

According to source, this group of "ladies" used to meet with Olga GUILLOT Vidal both in Cuba and here in Miami to hold "parties". One of Iden B's friends is Aida PEREZ Pozo, aka "La Gorda", who together with-Pat (aka "La Americana") are partners of a man called "Chucho" who is in jail on charges of narcotics trafficking in which he was recently surprised.

Source states that she is well acquainted with Iden B's intimate affairs because she knew her in Cuba and lived in her house here in Miami for one year.

26. Source 3: AMCRAG/1

On 17 May 1964, Francisco TABERNILLA Palmero talked to AMWORM/1 and told him KUBARK was investigating the private lives of AMBIDDY/1 and Iden B, because it seems it is feared AMBIDDY/1 is being infiltrated by "batistiano" elements.

The investigation that is being made of AMBIDDY/1 is quite publicly known in Miami.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

VIA: Deputy Chief, WH (Special Affairs)

SUBJECT: ANWORLD-Review of Deficiencies

1.  A meeting with AMBIDDY-1 has been called for weekend of 27 June in order to review certain deficiencies in ANWORLD management and, in this context, convey to AMBIDDY-1 expressions of Chief, WH's serious concern over manifestations of insufficient leadership in giving direction to and exercising supervision over the ANWORLD effort and the personnel assigned to it.

2.  In reviewing events of the preceding twelve months, it will be possible to balance praise and stricture. What has happened, it appears, is that after a flying start, the project is beginning to feel the effects of a devolution of CIA controls and that deficiencies in the quality of AMBIDDY-1's leadership now appear in more striking relief.

3.  In relating to AMBIDDY-1 our views regarding the state of ANWORLD affairs, we propose to dwell on following aspects:

a. Management Slippages, carrying over into the field of finances. Still no capable administrator. No indications disbursement of funds subjected to controls other than requiring receipts. Doubts whether any kind of budgetting still being enforced since we converted to straight and fixed subsidising. Faint odor of corruption.

b. Quality of Personnel. Leadership bracket poorly staffed. Since program's inception, recruitment drive

above field grade level either at standstill or unavailing. Why is it good people do not flock to ANWORLD's colors, especially after Pilon? Among reasons most frequently mentioned, AMBIDDY-1's alleged unwillingness to delegate authority and tendency to surround himself with dross of exile community which repels good elements. Sierra and Cantillo, who above average, have already quit.

c. Political Action. Other than what taken in hand by AMBIDDY-1 personally, media output of deplorably low quality. AMBIDDY-1 himself goofed after Pilon.

d. Operational Planning. June performance below par despite WAVE training and Jenkins' consultation. Last-minute choice of target in Pinar del Rio ill-conceived and slipshod.

e. Operational Security. Virtually non-existent. Twin-strike against Cabo Crus and Punta Maisi, originally scheduled for June 1964, prematurely blown and Cuban reception committees presumably lying in wait. Preliminary survey indicates likelihood proposes operation widely known in ANWORLD Miami circles. Leakage, therefore, not necessarily attributable to high-level penetration, but hypothesis such penetration exists is quite supportable.

Remedy: Headquarters will cease discussing operational plans inside U. S. and insist on passing intel abroad.

ANBIDET-1 has consistently ignored our advice to batten down hatches and prepare for major CIS onslaught, especially post-Pilon. His so-called intel section staffed with camp-followers and headed by a thug. Only professional (Major Gomez) about to be ditched.

f. Morale Situation. Poor, except maybe among combat cadres. ANTON-19 toying with idea to quit. Others may follow suit. Charisma no substitute for managerial ability. AMBIDDY-1's dissoluteness setting poor example.

g. "Adelaida." Clear indications she henpecks him and possibility that after one year of cohabitation he trusts her unreservedly, withholding nothing. Either

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 45

refuses to comprehend or does not realize the hugh
scandal potential of this relationship. Has proven
impervious to low-key advice that scandal could ensue
and that its full exploitation by Castro would be
foregone conclusion.

4. Above inventory of major defects in ANWORLD probably
   incomplete and partly based on hearsay and derived from
   patently prejudiced sources. Some manifestations of disarray
   may merely be concomitant of organizational shakedown and
   elimination of marginal personnel. Others may be presumed
   endemic ills of most resistance organisms left to own devices
   plus Cuban propensity to fractionalize. In final analysis
   we could probably justify the Agency input as long as ANBIDDY-1
   produces an occasional Pilon. Reconstruction of viable resis
   tance movements inside Cuba, however, is remote prospect,
   especially if we conclude that target area now virtually
   denied to all but singleton, short-term operators. Commando
   raids may continue to prosper as long as we are permitted to
   render intel support on its present level.

SUBJECT: Dabezzlement of Funds by Mario Delgado Suelueta

1.  Banbora reported that Delgado, who is the head of logistics in Costa Rica, was accused of embezzling $1,000 from ANWORLD. A/1 conducted a personal investigation of the case. The final outcome of the case: He was asked to make restitution out of his salary until the entire amount had been repaid.

2.  This case in point was brought up by Sambora to illustrate that A/1 rpends a great deal of his time on relatively minor tasks which could easily be delegated to someone else.

Dear Mr. Artime:

This is to acknowledge and to thank you for your thoughtfulness in writing to me.

It was very gratifying for me to mention your daring raid on the port of Pilon in my speech of May 20th.
*Felicidades*. I wish you the very best in your future actions against Castro who poses a grave menace to all of the Americas.

I am very pleased that through the Referendum the Cuban exile community now enjoys a central voice which can serve to co-ordinate effective anti-Castro activity. Hopefully, my Government will turn away from its ill-advised policy of restricting the Cuban exiles, and aid people like yourself to liberate the Cuban people from the Castro-Comunist dictatorship. To that end let me assure you of my continued support.

Please do not hesitate to write me again.

With every best wish, I am

Sincerely yours,

The following is a letter from AMBIDDY-1's father to his son.

8 June 1954

My dear son Manolin,

It has been a while since we have received a letter from you. We are writing this to find out how you are and we suppose you are well. Here everyone is well, thank God.

Your mother is not writing you because I am writing it quickly so that it can leave today.

We have presented everything since 20 March as well as depositing the price of the fares and we are only waiting for permission to leave which we will soon have. When it happens we will send you a cable.

Your Godmother Rosa is sick and when I saw her today she told me she hoped you would come to liberate her. Therefore we know you are doing your duty. I support your position. Don Jaime is well, thank God.

I saw Emilita and she sends her love. She also told me to tell you to write Lino and his brother a letter and to send it via this channel. Emilita is not going there until you send it (the letter) and it should be done through this channel if it is possible.

That letter which is addressed to Conseule data Campa de B. put a stamp on it immediately and mail it so it arrives at its destination. I am staying in her father's home and I am very anxious to help har.

ANWORLD Meeting in San Juan, 7-8 June 1964

SUBJECT: Adelaida Padron y Crus

1. AMBIDDY/1 himself raised this matter with me while neither James nor Ferrer were within earshot. Quoting AMYUM/18, he inquired whether marriage with Subject would be one of the causes for KUBARK to terminate the existing AMWORLD relationship. I emphatically answered in the negativa, going over by now well-trodden ground once more and, hopefully, making myself understood.

2. In summary, I stated we held no views one way or the other about his intent to contract marriage. Our concern was strictly political since we could visualize a number of unpleasant consequences flowing from the event. True or false, certain allegations had been made about Subject's past and there were a goodly number of people prepared to testify to the accuracy of those allegations, among them (I presumed) Subject's ex-husband. The political implications of the proposed union could not possibly escape him, especially if ANTHUG should get hold of it.

3. AHAJDDY/1 opined that he had lived in open sin with Subject for over a year. This was what was bothering him and evidently some of his closest associates, not Subject's alleged past. He needed this relationship with Subject to maintain (literal quote) his emotional balance. He was working under considerable strain and the rare moments with Subject alone were his sole relaxation. The issue of sin was deeply disturbing to him, and marriage, he felt, would resolve this situation of conflict. In order to avoid certain political repercussions, he was now giving thought to taking Subject with him to Nicaragua and contract a "secret" narriage. I did not point out to him the evident flaws in his reasoning and merely adverted to the great political responsibility he carries. I made it very clear to him that a major scandal could

conceivably crystalline opposition to his person and
sink the ship. Since I did not interpose an outright
veto (of dubious efficacy at best), he will undoubtedly
profess to have convinced me of the soundness of his
headlong rush toward matrimony and all that could entail
for our program. Short of making a mockery of autonomy,
I could not tell him any more than I did.

## ANVORLD Meeting in Ban Juan, 7-8 June 1964

## SUBJECT: ANBIDDY/1's Political Reporting

1.  I reminded Subject that in the past we had frequently pressed him to keep us abreast of his political activities with particular emphasis upon relations with the host governments in Central America. The response to our urgings had been increasingly disappointing and of late reached the vanishing polat. Since it was not curiosity that had prompted us to ask for timely reporting but a desire to be of service in protecting the rear, we were now wondering whether it would not be best to leave the determination whether or not to submit political reports to his rather than continue importuning him which was beginning to place us in a slightly ridiculous position. ANBIDDY/1 pleaded over-work in excuse of his failure to provide timely reporting and we resisted the temptation to point to other more likely causes of mental and physical Eatigue.

2.  As of now we believe to have reached a clear understanding with AMBIDDY/1 that as always ve stand ready to come to his succor if a political crisis or problen arises and is timely signalled to us. Silence will be construed by us as an indication that "all is vell."

SUBJECT: Purchase of House

1. I asked AMBIDOT-1 about rumors that he has brought a house in Miami and he admitted the fact without any show of embarrassment.

2. He claimed to have sunk his savings from the "Bay of Pigs" honorarium into the acquisition, i.e., $3,000, to have borrowed money from ARWORLD. Senora Padron y Crus had also chipped in to the tune of $1,500. I did not delve into the financial aspects of the transaction. AMBIDDY-1 claims that the home where he now lives with subject has been registered in the name of Nilo Messer. He mentioned in passing that a house might come in handy if his parents should be permitted to emigrate to the United States.

2. AMBIDDY-1 senior sent word that he is in touch with some old CP buddies who have offered to help him get out of PERUMEN. AMBIDDY-1 is anxious to pass a message to his father but not via QUANTUM 50 because of his distrust in the political orientation of 50's government. In this message, AMBIDDY-1 wants to suggest to his father that he induce an "old CP" emissary to meet with AMBIDDY-1 outside of PERUMEN, e.g. in Mexico. AMBIDDY-1 believes that the rift between ANTHUG's regime and the old CP offers unprecedented opportunities to cause mischief.

THE TROOPS THAT WILL OVERTHROW CASTRO ARE ALREADY IN CUBA

THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CHEERED HIM
WHEN THEY BELIEVED HIM A HERO OF
OUR LIBERTIES

Following is a translation of an interview of Manuel Artime by Agustin Camargo, as reported in the Spanish language magazine Bohemia Internacional, Caracas, Venezuela, 7 June 1964.

Q. - Your group has initiated a new offensive against the Castro regime during the last few days in cooperation with one carried out by other revolutionary units. Do you expect victory soon?

A. - Everyone knows when wars begin, but never when they end.

I would like to say that it will be soon, but my duty as a leader is to prepare the people of Cuba and the Cubans in exile for the kind of war we expect: a long, hard war, but one that we shall win if all Cubans pull together in accordance with their ability.

There may be imponderable factors, "surprises" which could bring about the fall of the tyrant; but we must never count on "miraculous" solutions, on invasions that do not exist or on organizations that will pull our chestnuts out of the fire.

Q. - Are you considering the possibility of eventually uniting your men and resources with those of the Cuban Revolutionary Junta or the Alpha 66 - II Front - MRP or any other unit that may be currently carrying on the struggle inside Cuba?

A. - The frontiers of our movement have never been closed to anyone who wants to fight for Cuba, with the exception of totalitarian movements either of the right or of the left.

What we do think wise to explain is that we do not believe in political action units in exile. We believe only in

[^1]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 68

unity of martyron, of sacrifice, of combat. We want the greatest success for our sister revolutionary organizations, which will never be objects of attack on our part because our only enemy is communism.

Q. - You personally and the M.R.R. in general have always been cited as "favorites" of certain North American groups or go-verimental agencies. Is that correct?

A. - I would like to have those who speak of this favoritism answer me this question:

Do they call the Bay of Pigs episode favoritism?

Do they call the two years I spent in jail waiting to put my back to the wall and be shot favoritism?

Do they call the state of abandonment in which the clandestine M.R.R. was left in Cuba after the battle of Giron Beach favoritism?

Do they call favoritism the fact that on my leaving jail I had to break with the Revolutionary Committee because it had been converted into an instrument for not carrying the war to Cuba?

Do they call favoritism the fact that we have had to leave American territory to be able to continue the struggle against Castre?

Do they call favoritism the fact that we have to fight a long war because we get no help from those who could make it short?

But these campaigns of "favoritism" do not surprise me.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 69

I know that International Con unisa cennot edit publicly that it is being defeated by the people of little Cuba who are only getting help from their brothers in Latin America, from God and from their indonitable desire to be Free.

Q. - Today you talk of bringing about uprisings in the forces of the Castro regime, and you seen to trust in this as the best way to liberate the island from Soviet and Comunist domination. Why didn't you take that position three years ago, since it was just as valid then as now?

A. - Three years ago we took the same position as today. Just remember that the M.R.R. was the first revolutionary organiza-tion to rise up against the tyrant Castro to try to overthrow him by internal action at a time when many were convinced that Fidel was a Communist but said "that it was not yet time to say so to the people".

Remember that the first weapons for internal rebellion were carried to Cuba by the M.R.R.

Remember that Francisco, the M.R.R. Coordinator in Cuba was not only the cheerful organizer of the resistance but also eventually the national coordinator of the whole clandestine movement.

Remember that the Bay of Pigs invasion was designed to be only the gold buckle to fasten up the stage of active re-sistance and guerrilla activities.

Remember the long list of over 150 martyrs of the clan-destine war of the M.R.R. which shown clearly the priority wo


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 70

assigned at that time to rebellion in the loca forces. Remember that before the rigade camps were set up there were infiltration camps provided especially to assist this internal rebellion.

Q. - Some international circles claim that Russia is abandoning Castro, that it has agreed on this abandonment secretly with North America, and that this is visibly evident in the gradual withdrawal of Soviet troops from the island. They add that confidence in this agreement has caused North America to "tolerate" this fresh outbreak of armed activities in the Caribbean. Do you share this view?

A. - Frankly I do not believe in international pacts that are not clear to me, and I believe much less in the willingness of Russia to carry out its agrements: Poland, Chechoslovakia and Hungary are historical witnesses of Russian treachery.

As for "tolerating our activities", I cannot speak, because we have not asked for "tolerance" for them. It never cocurred to me to "ask permission" to die for my country.

Q. - Would you subordinate the possibilities of liberation of your country to any advantage of an international nature for the United States?

A. - My country's interests are greater than those of any other nation. Any Cuban who does not believe that does not deserve to be called a Cuban.

I do not believe the United States expects such a shooking attitude from the Cubans. They may have many faults but


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 71

they respect the dignity of man.

This is not the first time we say publicly that this war of liberation of our enslaved Cuba must be carried on "no matter whom it pleases, no matter whom it displeases", since it is true that powerful nations have international obligations to carry out and it is also true that we Cubans h.ve our inescapable duties to our enslaved country.

Q. - If arned action within Cuba -- guerrilla war in the mountains and war of terror in the cities -- should, as ex- pested produce a wave of popular uprisings both among students and workers and in the military units of the dictatorship, do you think that the democratic nations of the hemisphere would come to our help? Aren't you afraid of a repetition of what happened in Budapest?

A.- Although I am convinced that at some definite moment they would come to our help, we cannot base our war on col- lective assistance. We must plan our strategy as a purely Cuban struggle from beginning to end.

Many Latin American nations have already helped us -in accordance with their ability and thanks to them we can do what we are doing.

As for the rear of a repetition of what happened in Budapest taking place in Cuba, we cannot forget that Cuba has no frontier with Russia.

Q. - Some foreign analysts and some governments have studied


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 72

the situation on the island and treat with Castro as if they believed that all hope of liberation had expired. Can you tell us something about the internal struggle against communisa?

A. - To think that all hope of liberation has expired in Cuba is to show a complete lack of knowledge of the condition and character of the Cuban people. The history of Cuba is a history of repeated martyrdon in search of real liberty.

I can say very little about the internal struggle that does not affect its security. But let it be sufficient to say that today there are guerrillas in five of the six provinces of Cuba; that the tyrant knows about them and that he has not been able to wipe them out because of the peasants' support for them; that in the cities the sentiment of the workers has begun to be mobilized toward passive resistance, and that within the very ranks of the militia Cuban patriots are forming independent cells.

Q. - From the days of the Bay of Pigs you seemed to trust blindly in North American material backing for your struggle. But lately we see you shifting your interest toward Latin American countries. Why?

A. - Actually my first glance was toward Latin America. I took residence in Mexico where I published my book *Traición* (Treachery) and I traveled around Latin America carrying the shout of alarm against communism. Afterward I went to North America in constant search of resources for the war, and although I have


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

never had blind confidence in anything human, because everything that is done blindly is done badly, it is true that I had confidence in North American material help. Reason: because we were seeing it. (I do not think it was a secret to anyone where the weapons we used in the invasion came from.) I had no scruples in accepting American weapons to offset those from Russia which Fidel Castro was receiving in gigantic shipments.

After leaving prison I lost coniidence in that assistance because since then not only have I seen none, but also I have not seen the possibility even of getting any.

Not only has my interest switched toward Latin America, but also my gratitude toward these people who have opened their arms to offer us help when all doors were being closed against us. Thanks to them we can continue the struggle.

Q. - What opinion do you think the conduct of nations like England and France deserve, who, turning their backs on principles they claim to hold and on moral and humane considerations, take part in propping up Castro's bloody regime by supplying him with credits and all kinds of financial backing?

A. - First I do not want to confuse countries with governments. Most peoples are innocent of the atrocities and treacheries of their governments.

That kind of behavior never surprised me in the case of the English government, as they did something even worse in Korea where their soldiers were dyingunder attacks from waves


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 74

of Chinese from red Manchuria while the government was selling steel to Fekin.

In the case of the French government I was sorrowful because of the figure of Gen. DeGaulle. As a young Cuban I used to hold in my heart the image of DeGaulle, hero of the Second World War, leader of his country's resistance in the fight against the foreign invader.

It was hard for me to realize that this same man would turn his back on the principles which made him beloved by the free world. It is unfortunate that such a brilliant career should have been darkened at its ending.

In any case, some day Cuba will be free and those governments can be sure that, if they do not alter their conduct, they will then receive their payment in the same historical currency that they have passed out to our martyred people.

Q.- You and your party have been accused of being fascists, of being a bee-hive for the Central Intelligence Agency and a "cover" for the worst political and economic interests of our country. What do you have to say about that?

A.- Nothing. Let my actions and my history answer the question. Those who are going to go on saying this are the Communists and the foolis tools of communism.

I believe it would be well to recall that the M.R.R. was the only organization at this stage of the Cuban struggle that, before apending its first funds for weapons, spont them


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

for publishing a statement of its ideology precisely because we wanted everyone to know where we intended to go, how we were going and why we were going there. This background statement circulated throughout the underground and the exiles. It contains our complete ideology, and the same thing is contained in the political testament that I wrote before leaving for the Bay of Pigs, as it also appears in my book *Marchas de Guerra y Cantos de Presidio* (War Marches and Prison Songs), written while I awaited death, as is clearly explained in the recent pamphlet about my full statement to the members of the A.R.E.C.

If wishing to carry to Cuba a state of independence, liberty, justice, respect for the dignity of human beings; if wishing to have the constitution of 1940 effective as long as it is not revoked by the same people who approved it; if opposing all demagogic extremes and all totalitarian impositions; if all this is being a fascist; then I am a fascist.

But since fascism is totalitarianism established by an oligarchy in the name of supposed racial purity, I cannot be a fascist.

As for the other accusations of obeying or being a cover for unsavory interests, I challenge anyone to give me the name of a single individual among our revolutionary directors who has a blemish in this respect; I challenge anyone to analyze the statistics of our martyrs; I challenge anyone to analyze our history.

Q. - Can you sum up in a few words the ideological base of M.R.R.?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 76

A. - Yes. We dream of independence with liberty, liberty with culture, culture with bread, bread for honest work, honest work with respect for the dignity of the human being; and all this in a democratic regime of Latin American character and Christian morality.

Q. - Would your group favor keeping some laws of the Revolution if it is proved that they correspond to some need, or do you think that the Fidel epoch should be swept out completely and a fresh start made?

A. - When Fidel's regime is overthrown, Cuban needs are going to be quite different from those of our country with the tyrant in power. I believe the laws he made which could answer real Cuban needs were badly conceived and directed even worse.

I believe that without fundamentally changing the 1940 constitution, which means for Cuba a return to the rule of law, it will be possible to make laws which will meet Cuban needs.

Q. - Are you opposed to the negroes?

A. - No; nor am I opposed to the whites, which means the same thing to me. What interests us is not the color of the skin but the color of the soul and of the ideals.

Perhaps that is why our movement is the one that has more black brothers in its ranks, including the highest civil and military positions.

Q. Do you favor, as has been stated, establishment in Cuba of a semi-confessional state with open predominance of the most conservative elements of the Catholic Church?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 77

A. - Neither of the most conservative nor of the most liberal; that would be "clericalism" and it is expressly condemned in Pepal Encyclicals.

I personally am a Catholic and will never deny my faith, because I have no vocation to be an apostate.

But of course, the movement is full of men of all ali- gions and creeds.

Certainly we shall reaffirm with the 1940 constitution our belief in God and the necessity for Christian norality.

We believe that every child has the right to receive preparation in whatever religion he chooses.

Q. - What will the M.R.R. do with the Rebel Army and the Mi- litia once Cuba is liberated?

A. Those who turn around and fight against the tyrant will be retained in the armed forces with the same rank as before. Those who do not will be discharged and returned to private life if they have committed no crime, but if they have, thay will have to answer to the civil courts in normal fashion, which will again function in Cuba in accordance with the 1940 constitution.

The only ones who have anything to fear are foreign Communists and members of repressive agencies.

९० ill the death penalty be maintained in Cuba?

As - I do not favor the death penalty, but of course since the 1940 constitution will be in force, this penalty is recog- nized only for treason. We must ond the revolutionary tribu-

11


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 78

nals and return to the rule of law.

Q. - Do you believe Cuban national interests when freed from communism will be better served if the nation is placed in a position of international neutrality?

A. - We shall always be an aggressive forefront of the West against comunism. We can never be neutral in a struggle in which the destiny of civilization is at stake.

Q. - Engineer Ray and you seem to be performing parallel activities as you approach almost five years of struggle against Castro and are apparently the two most important political figures of our future. Could you tell us what keeps you apart?

A. - Starting from the assumption that we are fighting for a democracy, any ideological difference between another group of Cubans and ourselves will be resolved in the future by the Cuban people in free elections. I do not think this is the historic moment to talk about differences. If the regime set up in Cuba after Fidel Castro is defeated is a totalitarianism or a dictatorship of left or right, we shall KEEP ON USING OUR GUNS.

Q. - Why don't you take the command of Brigade 2506 and why has it not been possible to consolidate around the brigade all the exile elements since it is the largest group of veterans of our war?

A. - A great many of our brothers of Brigade 2506 are already in our ranks. The brigade could not consolidate exiles around it because it was formed to be a military unit without political plane; recently arrived from Communist prisons, it went to North American army camps to continue its training. That is

18


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 79

why I left its ranks. I did not want anyone to say that I was trying to orient the brigade politically by trying to unite the exiles around it. Besides I thought that I was more useful to my country in trying to carry the war into Cuba than in receiving a training that I did not know whether I would put in practice some day. Tine has proved I was right.

Q. - What would you do, or what are you doing with the followers of Batista? Do you think this way of naming some people who form closed blocs with persons of very dissimilar history and interests, is real and does any good for Cuba?

A. - For me there are no *Batistianos* nor *Priistas* nor any other discriminative "ista". I only believe in a moral classification of men, and there are good ones and bad ones in all the governments our country has had. The only salvation for Cuba is to bring together all worthy and honest Cubans of all epochs, of all social classes, of all colors, and of all ages, into a new historical geveration to consolidate our nation after the traitor's regime has been overthrown. Poor Cuba if we continue to harbor sectarian hates and sterile discriminations:

Q. - It is said that you are an admirer of Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, that you are familiar with his ideology, and that his assistants say in private that you are an Antillean version of him. Is this true?

A. - It is a fact that I am familiar with Frimo Rivera's ideology, as I am also familiar with that of Mahatma Ghandi, Rousseau, Roosevelt, Lenin, Hitier and all the men who for mankind's


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 80

good or ill have left a political philosophy to history. A leader has a duty to understand them completely. But the ideologies that are most familiar to ne are moulded in the unforgettable thoughts of Jesus Christ, Marti and Bolívar. This is the first time I hear myself called an "Antillean version" of Primo de Rivera. If anyone says so, it must be in secret because I have never heard it. What I was called once was a "fascist" when I was in prison awaiting the death penalty; it was the traitor Fidel Castro in person. It is possible that he has friends in exile.

Q. - What do you consider the weakest of the Castro regime?

A. - The people, the people of Cuba, who would rather die on their feet than live on their knees; the people who now realize the total surrender to a foreign power and have seen the complete failure of Communist doctrine. The troops that will overthrow Fidel Castro are already in Cuba, the very people who cheered him when they thought him the hero of our liberty.

The presence of Russian occupation troops in Cuba has definitely revitalized the nationalist spirit of our country.

Q. What will you do in case you come to govern Cuba, with private schools, with the press and with private initiative of an economic nature?

A. In the first place, our fight is not for the purpose of putting me in the government; it is to make our country independent. But if you ask me what is my idea about what a govern-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 81

ment ought to do in Cuba in respect to these natters, my answer is: Regarding private education: protect it in every possible way, and raise public education to the same level as private.

Regarding the press: liberty of the press and assistance for the school for reporters to make Cuban newspaper men more efficient. The Cuban Dress will educate our peoples background so as to definitively wash the wounds which communism has inflicted on the spirit of our children and young people.

Regarding private enterprise: protection for it, assistance for small business, and by means of modern tax laws make sure that business performs its social function. The United States, Western Germany and many other countries can give us an exact idea of what we want.

Q. - What is your final message to your exiled people in this grave moment of history?

A. - That we cannot and must not trust in international solutions nor in easy paths to our country's independence. That we must return to the romantic spirit of our war of independence, to that difficult, self-sacrificing, hard war of a Martí collecting pennies and a Maceo spending them on bullets; to that war of Cubáns within and Cubans without against those who are no longer Cubans.

If every Cuban offers what he can; if we obtain, as was done in 1896, the fraternal embrace of our brother peoples; if we put the interests of a country that must be saved before our personal interests, Ouba will be independent. Because this bat-

of the country. And those guns, those tanks and those planes
are already being turned against the red beast. The little
western David called Cuba has already let fly the stone which
will knock down the ugly Goliath of communism.

# A CONTROVERSIAL FERSONALITY

It can be said of the Secretary General of the Movement for Revolutionary Recovery, Manuel Artine, that there is much to say, but never that he has lacked spirit to fight for the liberty of Cuba.

Combative and polemical, Artine today occupies a singular position in the fight against Castro in which he collects furious insults and almost fanatical proselytiem in equal quantities. Hir early struggle against Batista's dictatorship and his activity in Sierra Maestra in Column One commanded by Fidel Castro, made him an outstanding figure in the Revolution. His break with Castro and his denunciation of the olive green treachery to the great romance of the Cuban people made him the target for all attacks and insults. In the spring of 1960 Artime went into exile. In Mexico he wrote a book denouncing Castro's apostasy. With other eminent democratic leaders he helped icund the Revolutionary Front (later Committee) and exerted intense propaganda and political activity throughout the continent which oulminated in the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion. This was one of the most critical points in Manuel Artime's civic career. His activity in it -- personally heroic though it was -- helped throw on him the shadow of new attacks and suspicions. But it also converted him into a leader of the first rank which the maturity of a prison term and his conspiratorial and revolutionary activities afterward only enhanced.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 85

Manuel Anime has become today, by virtue of the attack
of his troops on Puerto Pilon, the principal figure of current
Cuban activity. His group has been hammered into one of the
most disciplined, one of the largest and most efficient in the
heroic struggle of the people of Cuba for their liberty. Con-
sequently everything he does and says is of passionate interest
for this people in exile, a people which wants to know closely
-- and they should -- the thoughts and activities of the men
who will probably lead them in the future.

This is why Manuel Artime is brought to these Cuban
pages of BOHEMIA, which have been, are now and will continue
to be the ideal civic rostrum for the people of Cuba.

Artime has the floor. . .

# MANUEL ARTIME EN LA TRIBUNA DE BOHEΜΙΑ

-LA TROPA QUE DERROCARA A CASTRO
YA ESTA EN CUBA

Es el pueblo que lo aplaudió cuando veía en él a un héroe de nuestras libertades.

Preguntas de AGUSTIN TAMARGO Fates de Guaya

P-Su grupo ha iniciado en los últimos dias una nueva ofensiva contra el régimen castrista, al unisono con la que desarrollan otras entidades revolucionarias. ¿Considera U'd. que la victoria será pronta?

R-Las guerras se sabe cuando empiezan pero nunca cuando terminan.

Me gustaría decir que será breve, pero mi deber como dirigente es orientar al pueblo de Cuba y al exilio cubano hacia si tipo de guerra que nos esperas una guerra dura y targs, pero que ganaremos si todos los cubanos colaboran en la medida de sus fuerzas,

Puede haber factores impon-cius gubernamentales norten-mericanas ¿Es eso cierto?

R-Yo quisiera que los qu hablan de este favoritismo me respondieran:

¿Consideran favoritismo el episodio de BAHIA DE COCHINOS?

¿Consideran favoritismo los dos años que me pasé en la cárcel esperando el paredón de fusilamiento?

¿Consideran favoritismo el estade de shandono en que quedó el M.R.R. clandestino en Cuba después de Pisys Girón?

¿Consideran favoritismo el que a mi regreso de la cárcel tuviera que romper con el Consejo Revolucionario porque se habis convertido en un instrumento para no llevar la guerra a Cuba?

derables, "sorpresas", que precipiten la calda del Tirane; pero aumca debemos desenasar en soluciones "milagrosas" de invasiones que no extates ni en organisaciones que nos saquen las castañas del fuego.

P-Contempla Ud. la posibilidad de una unión eventual de sus hombres y recursos con los de la Junta Revolucionaria Cubana, los del grupo Alpha 66-II Frente-MRP, o cualquier otro que esté luchando actualmente dentro de Cuba?

¿Consideran favoritismo el que hayamos tenido que abandonar el territorio norteamericano para poder seguir luchando contra Castrof

¿Consideran favoritismo el que tengamos que realizar una guerra larga por no recibir ayuda do quienes podian hacerta breve?

R-Las fronteren de nuestro Mevinsiento - Jamás han estado cerradas adas para nadie que tenga el deseo de combatir por Ouba, excepto para los movimientos totalitarios, sean do isquierda a de derecha.

Pero no me extrafñan cas campañas de "favoritismos". Yo sé que el Comunismo Interna-el mal no puede reconocer påbilcamente que está siendo derrotado por, ei pequeño pueblo cubano que no recibe más ayuda que in de los hermanos de Latinoamérica, la do Dios y el inderrotable doseo de ver Libre.

Lo que el es conveniente acin Fue es que no creemos en unidades politiqueras del exitte, Creemos solurumente en is unidad del martirio, del naeriftete, del combate. Nosotros desrames of mayor éxito a tus organisations revolucionarias hermunas, que jamás recibirán ataques de parte nuestra puse stusstro Anico enemigo es el Comunismo.

P.-Ud. habla hoy de provocar levantamientos en las fuerzas internas del régimen enetrista y y parece contiar en ello como la mejor vin para liberar a la isla del dominto soviético y comunista. ¿A qué atribuye el no haber numikto hace 3 años esa posición, que era entences tan correcta como hoy?

P-A Ud. personalmente y al M.R.R. en general se los the sofalede sempre come "favori de ciertos sectores o agone

R-llace & afiños asumimos la misma postura qus they havmon naumido, la conveniente recordar que et M.I.R. fue la peimera organización revalunto

activa y de movimientos guerri- lleros.

Es conveniente recordar la larga lista de más de 150 márti- res del clandestinaje del M. B. R., que indica claramente la esmeraldad que concediamos on aquel momento a la rebelión do las fuerzas internas.

Es conveniente recordar que antes de los campamentos de la Bahía existieron los campa- mentos de infiltración ervados especialmente para ayudar a esta rebelión Intorna.

P.-En ciertos arculos inter- nacionales se asegura que Ru- sia está abandonando a Castro, que ha negociado secretamente con Norteamérica tal abando- no y que ello se expresa visi- blemente en la retirada gra- dual de las tropas soviéticas de la tala. Se añade que es esta seguridad la que ha hecho que Norteamérica "tolere" este re- crudecimiento de las activida- des armadas en el Caribe, ¿Comparte Ud. este criterio?

R.-Sinceramento, no creo en pactos internacionales que no me consten y mucho menos creo en is Inaltad de Rusia par- ra cumplir sus pactos Polonia, Casecoslovaquia y Hungria son teatteca histériccs de la falonia rusa.

Con respecto a que "toleren nuestras actividadre", ne to sé, Re konma partido "toleren para ellas. No to me ha- brian en nuestra nyuuta? ¿No ha ocurrido "podle permiso" para morir por mi Petrta.

P.-¿Consideraría Ud. les nosibilidades de liberación de su Patria a las conveniencias de indole Internacional de los Es- tados Unidos?

R.-Los intereses de mi Pa- tria están por encima de los in- tereses de cualquier otra nación. El cubano que asi no lo crea no merece llamarse cubano. No creo que los Estados Uni- dos de Norteamérica pretendan de les cubanos esa monstruosi- dad. Ellos pueden tener muchos defectos pero respetan la dig- nidad del hombre.

No es la primera ves que de- nímca públicamere esta guerra de liberación de nues- tra Cuba esclava tiene que ser llevada adelante "güstele a quien le guste y pents a quien le pase", porque et es verdad que poderosas naciones tienen deberes internacionales que cumplir, ea verdad que nosotros los cubanos tenemos otros de- heres Includibles con nuestra Patria esclava.

P.-Si la acción armada den- tro de Cuba-guerra de que- rrillas en las montañas y gue- rra de terror en los ciudades- produjera, como se espera, una ola de levantamientos popula- res tanto entre los estudiantes y obrerms como entre los quer- pos militares de la diotadur- ¿cree Ud. que las naciones de- mocráticas del Hemisferio ven- drian en nuestra nyuuta? ¿No tome que se ropita in Buda- post.

R.-A pesar de que estoy cen- vencido de que en un momento deterruinado vendrian en nues- tra ayuda, no podemos basar nuestra querra en el hecho de esa ayuda colectiva. Tenemos que trasar una estrategia de lucha totalmente cubana, desde el principio hasta el final.

Muchas naciones latinoame- ricanas ya nos están ayudando en in medida de sus fuerzas, y gracias a ellas podemos hacer lo que estamos hartendo.

Con respecto ai temor de un Budapest cubano no podemos olvidar que Cuba no tiene fron- teras con Husia.e

P.-Algunos comentaristas extranjeros y algunos gobiernos juzgan la situación de la Isla y tratan con Castro, como si pensaran que alii ha muerto toda esperanza de liberación. ¿Puede decirmos algo sobre la lucha interna contra el Comu- nismo?

R.-Pensar que en Cuba La muerto toda superanza 60 beración do demuestra un dea- conocimiento total de la con- dición o latonineraria del Purga- bio Cubara, la Historia da Ou- ha se tine historia do martirio Inresante en busca do in var- daders lthartad.

Muy pown pundo decir de la lucha interna que no ofrece ta seguridad de la misma, pora bastonos enn dooir que hoy est dia esisten guerrtilas en 6 de las & Provincias de Cuba, que el Tirano conoce de ellas y que no ha podido exterminarias de- bedo a la colaboración del cam- pes'nado; que en las ciudades el movimiento obrero ha comenza- do a movilizarse hacia la resis- tencia pasiva y que dentro de las mismas filas de las milicias los patriotas cubanos se van in- tevrando en células indepen- dentistas.

P. Desde los dias de Bahia de Cochinos Ud. parecia confiar de modo elego en el respaldo material norteamericano a nuestra lucha Ultimamente, sin embargo, se le ha visto cambiar ei interés hacia los paises latinoamericanos. ¿Por qué?

R-En realidad, mi primers mirada fue hacia Latinoaméri- eat me establect en México don- de publiqué mi libro TRAICION y recorrt Latiacamérica dando o grito de alarma contra e Comunisino.

...no me consta que Rusia esté abandonando

Después de salir de presidie perdi confianza en esa ayuda, perque desde entonces, no sólo no la he visto, sine que ni si quiera he visto la posibilidad de conseguirta.

No sólo mi interés se ha denplazado hacia hacia Latinosibérica, sino también mi gratitud hacia estos pueblos que nos han abierto los brazos para brindarnos ayuda cuando todas las puertas se nos estaban cerrando. Gracias a ellos podemos continuar la lucha.

P.- Qué opinión le merece la conducta de naciones como Inglaterra y Francia que, de espaldas a principios que dicen sustentar y a consideraciones mismas de orden moral y humano, se vienen dedicando a apuntalar al sangriento régimen de Castro por medio de créditos y todo tipo de operaciones financieras?

R.- Primero, no quiero confundir a los países con los gobiernos. La mayor parte de los pueblos sou Inocentes de las atrocidades y traiciones de sus gobiernos.

Del Gobierno Inglés nunca me extrañó esa conducta porque algo peor hizo en Corea, donde sus soldados morían luchando contra las oleadas de chinos de la Manchuria roja, mientras el Gobierno le vendía acero a Pekin.

Del Gobierno fratebrée si me ha dolido. En la figura del Gral. De Gaulle mi corazon de joven cubano tenía la imagsa del De Gaulle héroe de la 2ª Guerra Mundial, lider de la resistencia de su país en la lucha contra el extranjero invasor.

Me costó trabajo pensar que este mismo hombre diera la espalda a los principios que le hicieron querido por el roundo libre. Es listima que una carrera tan brillante se haya epscado en su oraso.

De todas vianeras, algún día Cuba será Pure y pueden estar seguros esos Gobiernos que no cambian de conducta roci

# UNA PERSONALIDAD CONTROVERSIAL

Del Secretario General del Movimiento de Recuperación Revolucionaria, Manuel Artime, pueden decirse probablemente muchas cosas. Pero nunca que le hayan raltado arrestos para luchar por la libertad de Cuba.

Combativo y polémico, Artime ocupa hoy en la lucha contra Castro ene posición singuler en la que se recogen por igual denuestos furiosos y proselitismo casi fanático. Su temprana lucha contra la dictadura de Batista y su acción en la Sierra Maestra en la Columna 1 que comandaba Fidel Castro le hicieron una figura de relleva en la Revaluación. Su ruptura onn Castro y su denuncia de la traición verdeolivo a la gran geeta del pueblo cubano, to colocaron en el blanco mismo de todos los ataques y vilipendios. En la Primavera de 1960 Artime marché al dəstiarro. Escribió en México un libro denunciando la apostacia da Castre. Contribuyó a fundar junto a otros eminentes lideres democráticas el entonssa llamado Frente Revelupinne Flo (luego Consejo) y desarrolló una intensa actividad de orden propagandistioo y polities por todo el Continente que culminó en la fracasada invasión de Bahía de Cochinos. Aquel episodic co uno de los puntos mis críticos de la carrera civica de Manuel Artime. Su participación en él -heroica por lo demás en to personal contribuyó a arrojar sobre su figura la sombra de nuevos ataques y sospechas. Pero lo convirtió e la vez en un lider de primer rango, que la madurez de la prisión y la actividad conspirativa y revolucionaria posterior no han podido más que acrecentar.

Manuel Artime constituye hoy, por virtud del ataque de sus fuerzas a Puerto Pilón, un punto principal de la actualidad cubana. Su movimiento se ha forjado como uno de los más disciplinados, numerosos y eficientes en esta lucha heroica del pueblo de Cuba por su libertad. Por lo tanto, todo lo que éi haga y diga es de apasionante Interés para el pueblo criollo en el destierro. Un pueblo que desea conocer de cerca -y con. mucha razón el pensamiento y la acción de los hombres que probablemente to habrán de dirigir en el futuro...

Es por eso que Manusi Artime vieno a estas páginas cubaras de BOHEMIA -que eran, so y seguirán siendo la tribuna civica ideal del pueblo de Cuba.

Artime tiene la palabra...

P-Seria su grupo partidario del mantenimiento de algunas leyes de la Revolución. si se prueba que éstas responden a alguna necesidad, o cree que se debe barrer todo el periodo fidelista de un plumazo, comenzando de nuevo?

R-Cuando se derroque al réuimen fideista, las necesidades cubanas van a ser muy distintas a las que tenis nuestra Patriu cuando el Tirano οετρό el poder. Creo que las leyes que éi hizo, que podían responder a necesidades reales de Cuba, estaban mal concebidas y peor orientadas,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and Martin Ferrer

DATE : 4 June 1964 at 0930 hours

1. AMBIDDY-1 was advised that he should call the Panama Hilton upon his arrival in Panama and ask for Mr. Boysen or Mr. James.

2. Latest report indicates that the ADELAIDA will arrive at Monkey Point at 0400 4 June. A-l has obtained his re-entry visa. A-l was again asked to give us the tapes on his Venezuelan conference. A-l promised to have them done today.

3. A-1 was asked to please make sure that someone sees Mr. Barnes concerning the petroleum arrangements. It was mentioned to A-1 that Mr. Barnes has been waiting for over a week to see someone in A-l's organization. Mr. Barnes has been kind enough to offer his services and we feel it is unfair to keep this gentleman waiting. All plans to send Sixto Mesa and Mr. King today. A-1 will notify us of what transpired at the meeting.

4. A-1 intends calling later in the day because he has some other matters he would like to discuss with us.

DATE : 30 May 1964 at 1330 hours

1. AMBIDDY-1 called the office again to say that he would be meeting Al Burt at 1600. A-l inquired if it would do any harm in seeing Mr. Summ of the State Department since the latter mentioned to AMJAVA-4 that he had not seen A-1 in over a year. A-1 felt that a courtesy visit was called for. We advised A-1 that we could see no harm in visiting him.

2. A-1 reported that one of his pilots, Ginebra, had received an offer to fly planes in the Congo. A-l did not know if Ginebra would accept the offer.

3. We told A-1 that we had received a report that in a finca in Nicaragua called Marianita he had met several U. S. Air Force officers and asked if there were any truth to the report. A-l stated that one of their houses is located in Marianita but he had not met any U. S. officers there.

4. A-1 gleefully reported he contemplates making quite a lot of changes in Miami. A-l did not elaborate but it appears that most of the propaganda section will be leaving Miami.

5. A-1 was requested to obtain a position report of the DOLORES by 1 June.

6. We asked A-1 if he had any ideas of where AMBANG-1
   is at present. A-l is of the opinion that AMBANG-1 is
   probably hiding in some small island off Puerto Rico.

7. A-1 inquired if he could sue the *Newsweek* magazine.
   We advised him that he could sue but the likelihood of him
   winning the case was slight. A-1 was referring to the
   article which stated he intended to draw the United States
   into an open conflict with Castro. We asked if there were
   any truth to the matter. A-l laughed and said, "Of course
   not."

8. A-1 was advised that we consider 7 June a firm
   date for the Consejo meeting. The reason we are pinning
   him down to a specific date was because of the necessary
   preparations that have to be made prior to any meeting.
   A-1 said he would be there on that date.

1. AMBIDDY-1 expects to get his residency permit today from Immigration in Miami.

2. Concerning A-l's request that we choose frequencies for the 511 radios it was our opinion this task could be done by Felix Rodriguez. In the special commo training given to Felix, a course was specially geared to choosing the correct frequencies and the proper crystals. A-l mentioned the original request had sterwed from Felix. A-1 was informed that the reports we have gotten about Felix reflect that he likes to give the tedious jobs to someone else and this is the case here.

3. A-1 and AMJAVA-4 will be leaving for Nicaragua on 5 June.

4. A-1 asked if the Consejo meeting could be postponed until 9 June. A-1 was reminded when we originally asked him to pick a day for the meeting we considered it a dofinite commitment. A-1 écouteeddand said he would be there on 7 June.

5. The tentative date for the departure of the ADELAIDA for the operation is 7 June.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1

DATE : 30 May 1964 at 1230

1. AMBIDDY-1 stated that AMJAVA-4 will be meeting
   with Carl in Houston this afternoon.

2. A-1 wants to meet with the Consejo on 7 June at
   0830 in Panama City.

3. A-1 again reminded we would like to have the tapes
   on what transpired in Venezuela. Martin reiterated that
   in order to protect his interest we must have current
   intelligence concerning his organization.

4. It is the opinion of the Consejo that a frank,
   off-the-record talk with Al Burt of the Miami press would
   do no harm. We consider Burt to be a responsible newspaper-
   man and he may be in a position to help A-1 put the
   Pilon raid in its proper perspective. If A-1 thinks
   this is a good idea he should speak openly to Burt about
   the Pilon raid omitting the embroidery that has accompanied
   his recent press statements. A-1 was reminded this inter-
   view, if given, snould not mention or allude to KUBARK
   support. Since Burt is an ambitious journalist he may
   probably ask A-1 for a scap on his next raid; again we see
   no harm in this. A-l said he would ask Burt if he wanted
   to go on a future raid. We mentioned that we doubted he
   would accept the offer.

5. According to A-I, AMYUM-19 is still in New York
   and is expected in Miami shortly.

6. A-1 was informed that the ADELAIDA is scheduled to leave drydock on 31 May.

7. A-1 reported he has talked to Miguel Angel Quevedo of Bohemia Libre and representatives of *Life* magazine concerning the release of pictures to be taken by his own combat photographer. A-1 added, however, he had made no firm commitments.

8. A-1 was asked if his next operation had been given a name yet. He said the next one was to be called "Simon Bolivar." We told him that we already learned the code name and warned him against foose talk and the damages that could ensue.

9. A-1 was asked to contact Manolin Hernandez and inquire why the DC-3 cannot be in Panama before 2 June 1964. A-1 was advised that Petrosky can furnish a crew to pick up the plane if necessary but cannot since he has no contact with anyone in Costa Rica. A-1 stated he would call Hernandez in Costa Rica.

10. A-1 was informed that three men aboard the ADELAIDA have signed off and should be returning to Miami on 29 May 64 aboard KLM.

**SUBJECT:** Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and Martin Ferrer

**DATE:** 28 May 1964 at 1830 hours

1. AMBIDDY-1 called to say that he had just arrived in the United States and would only be staying a short period and then return to Central America for the next operation phase. He stated he wanted to discuss some matters with "Enrique" in Panama within the coming week. I advised him to let us know exactly when and where and we would be there.

2. A-1 inquired if AMJAVA- had requested rubber boats from us at the last meeting A-4 attended in Washington, A-1 was informed that we had discussed the matter but could not recall A-4 placing any order with the Consejo for rafts. A-l asked if some afts could be obtained in time for the coming operation. A-1 did not know the exact amount needed but would consult with A-4 and call Martin later in the evening. The rubber rafts could be sent to same address as were the village radios. A-1 mentioned they had the silent motors.

3. A-1 was asked to inquire what had gone wrong in Santo Domingo. A-l believes that the reason the JOANNE could not be put into drydock was because there was another ship in the military yard undergoing repairs. A-l vas advised that was not the information we had received and could he please check further. into the matter. A-l will have Rafael GARCIA confront President Reid and obtain the true story.

5. According to A-1 Maritima Bam now is officially registered in Nicaragua.

6. A-1 asked Enrique to convey to Mr. Archer his gratitude for the letter Mr. Archer had sent him.

7. A-1 is very pleased concerning the possibilities of extending his operational bases to Venezuela. A-1 was asked to send us a tape of what had transpired and the government officials with whom he had met.

8. GUERTLER again reminded A-19 that it was no longer sefficient to merely deny ODYOKE involvement in the project but was necessary to take positive steps to implicate other Latin American governments and create the impression of increasing difficulties with ODYOKE. It was left to A-19's discretion on how to do this, but when talking about his problems with AMWORLD-2, Sopo and Mole it was suggested that he do this in strictest confidence as just for the inner circle of AMYUM. This will guarantee the story proper dissemination.

# 27 May 1964

# ANWORLD MEETING IN WASHINGTON, D.C. 19 May 1964

SUBJECT: AMBIDOY's Reaction to Advice to
Delay Return to U.S.

1. ANJAVA/4 reported that ANYUN-19 conveyed to AMBIDDY-1 my advice that he not return to PEFREE right away, but permit the dust to settle. According to JAVA/4 this advice led AMBIDDY-1 to conclude that ODACID did not want him back in PEPRIME. In order to test this theory, AMBIDDY-1 decided to make a beeline for the U.S. Embassy in Managua to pick up his immigration visa.

2. (Headquarters has learned that the visa was promptly granted and we presume AMBIDDY-1's concern that he had been exiled a second time has as a result boon assuaged.). I asked ANJAVA/4 to tell ANBIDDY-1 that we would be honored to welcome him as a potential fellow-citizen. Also, our relationship was based upon complete mutual trust. Our job was to protect his rear in PBPRIME. What we were concerned about was that AMBIDDY-1, should be return at this tims, would undoubtedly be talked to by ODACID, ODENVY and the press. All this it would be beat to sidestep.

3. AMJAVA/4 was asked to convey to AMBIDDY-1 that we will tell him when the coast is clear. If this notwithstanding he should return to PSPRIME, the decision would, of course, be his. "It is his right to come back at any time, but I think my advice is good."

26 May 1964

AMWORLD MEETING IN WASHINGTON, D.C. 19 May 1964

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY'S PERSONNEL POLICY

1.  ANJAVA/4 offered the following analysis of ANBIDDY-1's personnel policy as a significant facet of his relationship with others.

2.  ANBIDDY-1 is a leader and a very proud leader who does not like to fail in the presence of his associates.

3.  ANJAVA/4 was glad that the Miami incident (13 May press conference) happened. "AMBIDDY-1 was really angry with himself."

4.  From the start ANJAVA/4 has tried to convince ANBIDDY-1 that Jose MOLE ROSALES is not qualified for intelligence - so far in vain. "To let MOLE fail in doing the job is the way to convince AMBIDDY-1"

5.  ANTUM-19 cannot handle MOLE or Edgar SOPO, because ANBIDDY-1 won't let him. "We shall have to wait until they fall down on the job."

6.  ANJAVA/4 claims to have a closer relationship with ANBIDDY-1 than does AMYUM-19. He thinks he understands AMBIDDY-1 better than does ANTUM-19, that he (ANJAVA/4) knows how to get things from AMBIDDY-1. AMYUM-19 makes the mistake of using the direct approach where it would be better to go about it in a roundabout way. "There are some things which you BECKHOFF tell GUERSELER, then GUERTELE tells ANTUM-19 who tells ANBIDDY-1, which it would be better to tell AMBIDDY-1 direct." AMJAVA/4 related that ABIDDY-1 took umbrage at ANYUM-19 for conveying to his BECKHOFF's views about the Miami press conference. ANMIDDY-1 was furious when GUERSELER passed intelligence about the alleged presence of 50 cal. machine guns positioned near Pilon, because he considered this an implied attack of the soundness of the Pilon plan which ANBIDDY-1 himself had drawn up.

7.  Headquarters reps pointed out that during the

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 113

-2-

critical period following the Miami press conference, ANTUM-19 was the only available, cleared chamel to AMWORLD and time, in view of GUACID's unfavorable reaction, was of the essence. AMJAVA/4 was asked to convey this explanation to AMBIDDY-1 and to stress that we consider ANYUM-19 his senior rep in FBPRIME.

8. ANJAVA/4 stated that there had been many betrayals and consequently AMBIDDY-1 was always careful. At times he might even think that AMYUM-19 was not loyal which, ANJAVA/4 added, "Of course is not true." As AMBIDDY-1 analyzes his own performance, he is satisfied that he is performing well. He has been in the resistance business since Batista's days and many intimate friends have be- trayed him. At the present moment, he does not have 100% confidence in anyone. Everything he is told, he analyses. As an example, AMJAVA/4 briefs Chaves (the Mexican) on a projected operation. AMBIDDY-1 will question ANJAVA/4 closely in order to make sure that the instructions did not deviate from the plan as conceived by him.

9. Among matters which should be taken up with ANBIDDY-1 direct, no matter how ticklish, was e.g. the case of ...HOLE. ANJAVA/4 and AMYUM-19 know that KUBARK have a poor opinion of him. Then why beat around the bush? AMJAVA/4 at least had not witnessed any mention of this by BECKHOFF in AMBIDDY-1's presence. Instead ANTUM-19 had reported GUEKIELER's statement that he con- sidered HOLE a poor choice for the intelligence job to AMBIDDY-1 and the latter had juped to the conclusion that it was AMYUM-19 putting words into GUERÍKLER's mouth.

10. BECKHOFF comented as follows: ANTUM-19 will have to tell CUEKERLER or myself if in a gives instance a personal demarche is indicated. There are certain things which, with AMBIDDY-1 out of the country, simply camot be put en the shelf. We have no choice but to tell CUERSELER to tell AMYUM-19 who, however, should feel free to counsel not to ese tin as a channel. Headquarters rep conceded that AMBIDDY-1 could rightly resent anything which smocks of a junior officer (1.6. OUERTKLER) giving orders to him via ANYUM-19, an impression we would do our best to eradicate.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 114

11. BECKHOFF stressed that we were anxious not to
    give AMBIDDY-1 the impression that there exists any
    special relationship between us and AKTUM-19, AMJAVA/4.
    Our relationship was with AMBIDDY-1 who is the leader
    of the movement. AMJAVA/4 replied that he had told AMBIDDY-1
    this and that BECKHOFF had made this point very clear at
    their first meeting in Puerto Rico (see AMWORLD Meeting
    memo, 3-6 September 1963 Subject: Briefing of AMJAVA/4.)
    BECKHOFF added that he had told AMYUM-19 and wished to
    repeat this in the presence of AMJAVA/4 that anything
    discussed while AMBIDDY-1 was not present, could be told
    his. Nothing was "off-the-record" in the sense of to
    be withheld from AMBIDDY-1.

12. According to AMJAVA/4, AMBIDDY-1 knows full
    well that KUBARK considers him the Chief. If we decided
    to conspire against AMBIDDY-1 in league with AMJAVA/4
    and AMYUM-19, this could only be done within AMYUM, the
    political movement, since AMJAVA/4 and AMYUM-19 form pars
    of that organization. Our support, however, is to
    AMBIDDY-1 and not AMYUM. AMBIDDY-1 knows that.

CUBA

"Something Is Moving"

"This is Radio Free Cuba the anti-Commurist voice of Cubs broadcasting on the 40-meter hand. Wowder milino-maan, rebel soldier, radio ham-strip topple the despot! Close ranks so that the fatherland, today blinded by Russian imperialism, becomes the numb of Communism in America. This is Radio Free Cuba transmitting from a point in Cahan territory."

In Cuban exile communities from Miami to Caracas, the word was out: "Algo se mueve"-Something is moving. First came the faint, crackling anti-Castro broadcast last week frons Inside Cuba. Then 24 hours later came word of the biggest raid in months on Castro's fortress. The raiders identified themselves as members of the Move-ment for Revolutionary Recuperation, led by Manuel Artime, who headed the abortive Bay of Pigs landing.

At 10:30 p.m., said an M.R.R. spokesman in Miami, Artime and a "strong force of commandos" had gone ashore at Puerto Pilón, 145 miles from Guantánamo on Cuba's southern coast. Linking up with a second force of guerrillas from the nearby Sierra Mnestra mountains, the exiles had captured the town and held it for three hours against Castro's militia, during that time declaring it a "free territory of Cuba." They then blew up the Cabo Cruz sugar mill and disappeared. Puerto Pilón, the exiles noted with satisfaction, was only a few miles from the spot where Castro himself originally landed in 1956, and the Sierra Maestra was his sanctuary in the early stages of the revolution.

Within hours, Radio Havana was on the air railing about the attack. Castro dcried that the cries had seat ma laming party. The mill, he fumed, was bombarded from the sea by a pirate vewed of the Res type, which the IA operates irom hases located in Flornia, Ристо Rico and Central America." Nevertheless, he minutted damage to shore installations and cried that "70,-000 sacks of sugar" had been destroyed. Naturally, he blamed "a new criminal, vandalistic act by the United States Government." Two days later, Castro's internal radio reported two more landings one by Artine on the southern coast, and the other by Underground Leader Manolo Ray somewhere in the north. But exile groups in Miami would neither confirm nor deny the new raids.

Recruits & Munitions. In Washington, the State Department blandly denied all "These attacks," said a spokesman, "are neither supported nor condoned by the Government." Perhaps not, but Miami was alive last week with exile activity. Once again, Cubans were turn-ing up at the old clapboard house on 2.3rd Street that served as a recruit-ing center for the Bay of Pigs opera-tion, getting physical exams, then mys-teriously dropping out of sight. Small groups of Cubans were training at iso-lated farms outside Miami. At Key Largo, a 28-ft. launch loaded with exile munitions caught fire, was popping while firemen were trying to douse the blaze.

No one believes that a second frontal invasion is in the offing. The exiles agree that it would amount to suicide. What does seem to be in the works is an attempt at infiltration, sabotage and guerrilla warfare. Right now, three main groups are operating:-

►The M.R.R., headed by Artime, re-portedly has the strong backing of Nicaragua's Tachito Somoza and other anti-Castroites in Central America. Artive, say exile sources, operates from camps stretching from Costa Rica north to Honduras. A U.S. hunter in the northeastern jungles of Costa Rica recently stumbled onto a camp with three large buildings and a landing strip that was in constant use by light eir-craft: "Cubans," said his guide, Artime does not have the kind of support inside Cuha to operate a major under-ground, is gearing his efforts to sabotage teams inside Cuba and commando Falls against 17 coustal targets.

►The Junta Revolucionaria Cubana (Jure), led by Ray, a onetime Castro leader and a popular man inside Cuba, Ray gets his moral-and reportedly considerable material-support from Venezuela's former President Romulo Betancourt and Puerto Rico's Muñoz Marin, is said to operate training camps in both countries. He hus widely published May 20 as his deadline for returning to Cuba to revitalize the in-land's anti-Castro underground. Last week Ray resigned his job as a con-sultant to the Puerto Rican Pnning Board, and dropped out of sight. He n tough, shrew and a man of his word. "We are not worried," he says. "Castro is the man who must worry."

► A cation of Alpha 66, the Revolutionary Movement of the People, the Second National Front of Escambray and one or two smaller outtia led by Eloy Gutiérrez Mezayo, a long-time guerrila leader who fought against Batista. Menoyo plans to infiltrate a small force into Cuba-probably into the central Escambray Mountains and start up a guerrilla network. Two weeks ago, Menoyo lett Miami. The exiles say he is in Cuba.

Turn of the Screw. If the U.S. nor directly involved, some U.S. influence and support seem apparent. Washing-

ton reportedly gave Artime the green light last July. Recruiting personnel and collecting arms would also be difficult without at least tacit U.S. approval. And then there is the U.S. economic embargo. The British and French deals fue leases, trucks and locomotives not-withstanding. Castro remains virtually cut off from free-world traulo: As another turn of the screw, Washington a week tightened controls on U.S. exports of food and drugs to Cuba. Both had been exempted from the general U.S. trade embargo. Now export-ors will need CGovernment approval for shipments.

Brazil last werk finally took the action everyone had expected since the revolution that overthrew loftist President João Cioulart. Cuban agents, said the Brazilian government, had been engaging in "ollemive" propaganda "In-compatible with shummi wihi Chirine Han principles. Such interference in the Interiorul affairs of Brazil can no longer be tolerated." Diplomatic relations with Cuhu were therefore formally and off-ftotally savered.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Tad Szulc
Telephonic Conversation

1. Tad Szulc called the undersigned at home shortly before 2300 on 18 May 1964 from Miami, Florida. I began the conversation by telling Szulc that I had discussed the matter of a contact in the Miami area; and that it was our opinion that we could best collaborate with him from Washington inasmuch as it was only here that the full story is known. Szulc accepted this with the comment that he would naturally go along with our judgment in this matter. The essence of our general conversation follows:

a. Szulc Meets with RAY in Caribbean.

Toward the end of our conversation, Szulc interjected the statement, "Oh, I guess I had better tell you because you will read it in the paper in the morning, that I have just come from a meeting with RAY." Szulc gave the impression of being very satisfied with his trip and convinced that RAY was fully prepared for his venture. In answering a question that I had raised on 18 May, Szulc informed me that he was convinced that there was no serious dissension within the ranks of the JURE. It is my opinion that this is true, but that there are small frictions which are particularly inherent in Cuban organizations. I commented to Szulc that if he had just seen RAY, then in all likelihood RAY would not be in Cuba by the 20th. Szulc assured me that he would be in Cuba by the 20th. (Note: On 17 May I spoke with Regalio CLASEROS, who informed me that he would have an important message for me in two or three days. I have a premise from RAY and CISNEROS

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 122

that we will be the first to know of KAY's arrival in Cuba. Szulc reiterated his basic theme that RAY's effort is the last hope to free Cuba. I told Szulc that I certainly felt that RAY's contribution is tremendously important. In this connection I observed that RAY's drawing power was obviously increasing for I had only recently received a query from rather conservative elements asking if it would be proper for them to speak with RAY's representatives, specifically Rogelio CISNEROS. I told Szulc that in keeping with our policy, I had said that RAY and his group appeared to represent a patriotic and dedicated group interested in the liberation of their country and in the restoration of a democratic government. I told the person calling me that it might be wise to speak to RAY's group now when the opportunity presents itself rather than to face the possibility of having to stand in line later. Szulc indicated that he knew of which group I was speaking and he undoubtedly would as Rogelio CISNEROS probably told him of the contact recently made by members of the Cattlemen's Association of Cuba.

## b. Defection of Samuel RODILES.

Szulc then asked me if I had heard of the defection of Samuel RODILES. I told him that I had not and that in all likelihood if such a thing had happened, I should know about it.

## c. Blas ROCA Breaks with Castro.

Szulc then told me that he had heard via Mexico that Blas ROCA had a falling out with Castro. I again had to tell Szulc that I did not know of any such development, but that I seriously questioned it as this made no sense at all and that Blas ROCA will not openly break with Fidel Castro unless ordered to do so by the Soviet Union. I told Szulc that Blas ROCA is too much of a fox to ever even consider such forthright action.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 123

4. Alert in Cuba.

Szulc then informed me that the NEW YORK TIMES had heard via Richard Eder to the effect that the tightest and most general alert in the history of Cuba appeared to be in the making. Eder and all other correspondents have been restricted to Havana. When Eder attempted to make a trip to Pinar del Rio, he was denied this privilege. While discussing these matters with the NEW YORK TIMES by telephone, Eder was cut off and they have not heard from him since. This was presumably yesterday, 18 May.

e. Szulc Asks about General Situation.

Szulc was quite eager to hear something of the general situation in Cuba at this time. I told him that I believed the alert in Cuba was a result of the attack on the sugar mill some days ago and the mounting psychological pressure of RAY's publicized intent to return to Cuba. Szulc then added that in his opinion RAY's publicity was a good thing, particularly given that it was played in a basically moderate key. I agreed with Szulc on this. I then told Szulc that I had heard only a few hours earlier that there was a widespread rumor in Miami to the effect that a U-2 had been shot down over Cuba but that as far as I know, this was not true. Szulc then naturally asked me: "You would know if this had happened, wouldn't you? You would have heard this from the Defense Department." I answered that it certainly wouldn't be very long before we would know of such a thing, and therefore I did not believe there was any truth to this rumor.

3. On 18 May I discussed with Henry Heckener the possibility of his releasing certain information regarding MWORLD which I might subsequently provide to Szulc. In light of this, Henry gave me some indication of the type of thing which he would like to see picked up by the press, the essence of which is an attempt to create a better press

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 124

# Image for AKTIKE

Image for AKTIKE. In talking with Szulc, the subject of AKTIKE arose from time to time. Szulc mentioned that it had come to his attention that AKTIKE was in New York "with some babe or another" and nowhere near the scene of the strike. Szulc was also extremely critical of the press releases made by AKTINZ. I took this occasion to say that I had discussed the matter of AKTIKE with people who are much more familiar with his activities than I, given that they are in another geographical area, and that it was my impression that AKTIKE is not being given as much credit for his efforts as perhaps he should be and that it may well be that he has fairly solid plans which cannot be actually initiated until such a time as he has welded together the nucleus of a new organization under fire. Once experienced in their present activity, it could well be that AKTIKE could follow the RAY concept of developing resistance within. I told Szulc that I believed that the activities of AKTIKE and Kloy GUTIERREZ Menoyo could not but help RAY's program. Szulc's basic reaction to favorable statements regarding AKTIKE may be best described as a snort.

# ANWORLD Meeting in Washington, 19 May 1964

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY-1's Relations with Adelaida Padron y Crus..

1. ANJAVA-4 remarked that AMBIDDY-1 had not mentioned to anyone that BECKHOFF had talked with him about this affair. (Bee ANWORLD Meeting Memo 15-16 Feb 1964, Subject: Adelaida Padron y Cruz.)

2. ВЕСКНОFF re-affirmed that the matter had been raised in compliance with his visbes that we let him know about any derogatory informabion on subject. He had been told "in slow English" that we in fact had information from several sources which testify to Subject's former intimate relations with Fulgencio Batista. BECKHOFF had drawn ANBIDDY-l's attention to the following alternatives:

a. Rumors are true. AMBIDDY-1's decision is obvious.

b. Rumors cannot be confirmed. How serious is the damage they cause to AMBIDDY-1s public position.

3. AMBIDDY-1 had listened carefully, merely commenting that all this was "very interesting." He had not been pressed to make a decision. Specifically, BECKHOFF had told him that Subject vas reputed to have been the mistress of other pro-aizent Cuhans, besides Batista, and that AMBIDDY-1 could conceivably be blackmailed by JURE and the press, to mention only a few sources of threat presumed knowledgeable.

4. AMBIDDT-1 had not been told that his affair with Ahjoot was liable to jeopardize AMWORLD. After all, he was an intelligont man who did not have to be told the ebvious, vis. that a press scandal would be serious indeed. DAIMOLD, water had consulted, had taken the position that AKBIDDY-1 should reach the necessary conclusions himself. Our position was that AlNBIDDY-1 could not run a political Lovement unless he could handle his personal affairs. The blackmail potential in thioaffair vas serious as far as KUBARK is concerned.

5. ANJAVA-4 believes that the problem in relatione between AMBIDDY-1 and AMYUM-19 stems from the fact that the latter has discussed Subject with ANBIDDY-1. AMYUM-19 and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 126

ALJAVA-4's plans call for a threat to quit AMWORLD if ANBIDDY-1
makes known his decision to marry Subject. In the same breath,
ANJAVA-4 stated that he had not made his views knova to AMBIDDY-1.
"because then our position would be the way it is now with
ANTUM-19. You cannot put ANBIDDY-1 to the wall. He must be
led to believe that it was he who made up his mind."

6. In forecasting his and ANTUM-19's strategy, ANJAVA-4
   stated the following:

"ANTUM is not just ANBIDDY-1. It is all of us. He
is working for ANYUN and in that regard is answerable to
all of us, because be is part of AMYUM. When we talit
about the Adelaida problem, we talk about a problem
arising within the organization. AMBIDDY-1 knows that
he will have KUBARK's support which is meant for him not
for AMYUM. But in ANYUM we have to decide. Even the
people in jail inside Cuba want to know if it is true that
AMBIDDY-1 has a mistress and believe that we are condoning
this. AMBIDDY-1 is not only answerable to use but to the
people in jail. We, in turn, are responsible for our
inprisoned courades. As part of AMYUM I have to decide
if I will fight or not. ANBIDDY-1 is clear on that."

7. In stating our position, we made clear to ANJAVA-4
   that marriage is not a deciding factor in determining our
   course of action. An ensuing scandal might force our band.

Adelaida PADRON is about 26 years old and she is from Yaguajay, Las Villas province. She was a protégée of Fulgencio BATISTA Zaldivar since she was 14 years old. She married Kajor Roger ROJAS Lavernia and has two children, 5 and 6 years old. According to source, her youngest child is by BATISTA.

Adelaida PADRON was also the mistress of Marcos PEREZ Jiménez, former President of Venezuela.

In addition to being a very attractive woman, Adelaida PADRON is also very intelligent.

According to source, on various occasions (did not specify dates) Adelaida PADRON has talked to BATISTA on the phone from Miami.

SOURCE 3:

P-96 had a conversation with Nazim ELIAS Thumas and told ELIAS that some days ago a Cuban exile lady who was from the City of Santa Clara, Las Villas province, had expressed herself in very bad terms and had criticized AMBIDDY while she was in the "Optica López" optical store. That the lady had said A-1 had abandoned his fiancée, who is a good girl, to live with another woman who had been married to Roger ROJAS Lavernia.

After hearing this, ELIAS told P-35 it was true that A-1 was living with the ex-wife of ROJAS Lavernia.

By the way in which ELIAS answered P-96, it can be understood that ELIAS knows said lady perfectly.

During the conversation, ELIAS told 8-96 that when he had arrived in the U.s. Naval Base at San Juan, Puerto Rico, from ➔, base authorities were ⋯⋯⋯⋯. from him the authorization to تتنللن تتت

DATE : 8 May 1964 at 1030 hours

1. The undersigned reminded Mike GEIDEL that it is essential that AMBIDDY-1 meet with "RODEMEYER" when the former returns to Miami.

2. Mike stated that YERGO (MRR Dominican Republic delegate) had received a telephone call from President Reid or some other high official in the Dominican Republic which stated that President Reid would like to meet with AMBIDDY-1 on 12 May in the Dominican Republic. YERGO was also informed that they could have anything they wanted in the Dominican Republic.

3. Martin next brought up the subject of the MID. It was GEIDEI's impression that this organization might be nothing more than a provocation. This opinion is also shared by JMWAVE. Mike commented that AMYUM-19 has met with members of this organization who for the most part are unwilling to return to Cuba. A-19 would like to test their mettle before negotiating with them any further. A-19 intends to give this organization some sabotage materials and see what happens.

WH-1828

Records of the US Immigration Service show that Manuel Artime has made numerous trips in and out of Miami between 5 and 13 May 64. INS records show the following:

a. On 30 April Artime was issued an I-512 type visa good for travel to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. He departed from Miami on 3 May 64 for Managua, Nicaragua on Lanica Flight number 415. He returned to the US on 11 May 64. No flight information available on return trip.

DATE : 11 May 1964 at 0930

1. AMBIDDY-1 telephoned from the Miami airport to say that he would be leaving in two hours for the Dominican Republic to meet with President Reid on the morning of 12 May 1964.

2. A-1 expects to meet with PETER C. KNITTEL and Tom Murphy at the Miami Airport this morning before A-l departs for Dominican Republic.

3. A-1 vas advised that Mr. Alfredo RODEMEYER would like to meet with him at the Holiday Inn at Coral Gables upon A-l's return tomorrow. A-1 stated he would be at the Holiday Inn after 1800 on 12 May 1964. A-1 was assured this meeting had nothing to do with our operations and not to worry.

4. A-1 has given the commo plans to A-19 who will give them to Nike GUERTLER (P) sometime this afternoon.

5. Due to AMJAVA-4's late arrival in Nicaragua the entire schedule for the operation has been pushed back one day since the ship left one any late. A-l also mentioned there have been some minor changes in the land operation.

6. Manolin Hernandez is now in Panama dealing with Mike Petrosky concerning the DC-3. A-4 apparently had a narrow escape on a Nicaraguan plane and A-1 appears determined to have his own plane in the air..

7. According to Maagdenberg, the Dutch engineer, the ship is in fairly good condition and should require no more than five days in drydock. A-1 casually mentioned that the Dutchman had to be dissuaded from going on the operation itself.

8. A-1 was reminded we must have a firm statement from him as to when the operation is to take place if we are to be of assistance to his organization during the critical period. A-1 stated he had promised to break the heads of the commo people aboard the ship if they fail to advise him as to when the Swift departs from the mothership.

9. A-1 would probably leave for Nicaragua on Wednesday to be at the base in time for the operation.

1. According to ANYUM-19 (DOI 4 May), AMBIDDY-1 once more is giving serious thought to contracting marriage with Subject.

2. According to ANYUM-19, AMBIDDY-1 suffers pangs of conscience and has premonitions of hell. What he has in mind is a church wedding with all the trimmings. Since Subject's previous marriage was not solemnized by the Church, AMBIDDY-l's conscience appears unbothered.

3. ANYUM-19 claims that AMBIDDY-1 brushes off allegations about Subject's alleged affair with Fulgencio Batista as mere calumny. He does not know whether AMBIDDY-1 has ever asked Subject to confirm or deny the rumor.

4. The root of the trouble, as ANYUM-19 sees it, is that AMBIDDY-1 in the person of Subject is encountering a seasoned pro who plays with consummate skill upon his vanity and who exploits his naivete which is that of "a 14 year old." AMBIDDY-1, in fashioning personal relation-ships, is unable to make adjustments to the circumstance that, being a person of some importance, his personal affections are not always cultivated on purely unselfish grounds.

5. ANYUM-18 claims that Subject's former husband, Roger Hermilio Rojas Lavernib, is attempting to blackmail AMBIDDY-1 and that some of AMBIDDY-1's seemingly closest associates may be harboring similar designs.

6. BECKHOFF restated the position of KUBARK as one of non-intervention as long as matrimony is kept in abeyance. Conversely, marriage and any ensuing scandal would force us to re-assess our position and, in extremes, might force KUBARK to withdraw its backing of ANWORLD.

7. ANYUM-19 expressed the view that AMBIDDY-1 would probably forego marriage if made aware of KUBARK' position as stated above. We rejoined that AMBIDDY-1, should he solicit our views (but not otherwise), would be told just that.

8. GUERTLER is hereby authorized to state KUBARK's position along lines indicated in Para 6 if the occasion presents itself.

2. The undersigned requested of A-1 that he make quite clear to President Reid that AMWORLD is not receiving aid from the United States. A-1 was warned about making innuendos or ambiguous statements concerning American aid.

3. A-1 stated he would inform this office as soon as arrangements to go to the Dominican Republic were completed. A-1 was advised that we will be in Puerto Rico on Sunday 2 May.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between Martin Ferrer
and AMBIDDY-1

DATE : 29 April 1964 at 1100

1. AMBIDDY-1 was reminded that he should make a quick trip to the Dominican Republic to see President Reid and to arrange for drydocking and refueling facilities. A-1 was advised to use a more subtle approach than used on Colonel Lopez of Honduras. A-l's main objective should be to get "his foot in the door" in the Dominican Republic. A-1 should pursue the soft sell rather than the hard sell. Since he sounded a bit reluctant to forego the next operational phase in order to repair the ADELAIDA, A-1 was reassured that the overhauling of the ADELAIDA would take place after the operation rather than before. A-1 will take AMJ/AYA-4 with him to the Dominican Republic. Should President Reid ask for the name of the shipping company who will act as the agent for Maritima Eam, A-1 should say it is the Boyd Brothers Shipping Company.

2. A-1 was asked if he had obtained his U. S. visa. A-1 replied he has all the documents ready and will request it next time he goes to Nicaragua.

3. A-1 has no objection to AMYUM-19's attending the next meeting in Puerto Rico. The undersigned informed A-1 that we are preparing the intelligence data on the targets he requested, and they will be presented to him at our meeting.

4. A-1 commented if it would be possible for Kelly to arrange fueling facilities at Bluff with Texaco Oil rahter than Esso. The person in charge of the Esso company in Bluff apparently is not in sympathy with MRR movement; therefore, A-l is reluctant to deal with Esso. A-1 inquired if the person in charge of Esso could be replaced. A-1 was informed that although Kelly enjoys a great deal of influence with Esso we doubt that he has that much influence. As it stands now the LCM obtains supplies there and it is then tranferred to the ADELAIDA because A-l is reluctant to take the ADELAIDA near the Esso installation.

5. In conclusion A-1 was complimented on the manner his organization behaved during the operation.

6. Should A-1 obtain any definite information as to when he will be going to the Dominican Republic he should call our office in order that we may make our own traveling arrangements.

1. The undersigned telephoned AMBIDDY-1 at his home in
   an attempt to reach him before his return to Miami became

2. A-1 was advised that one of the most urgent matters

   for the ADELAIDA.

3. It was obvious from the sound of A-l's voice that

# ANWORLD Meeting in San Juan, P. R., 2-3 May 1964
SUBJECT: Reality of Autonomy

1. On 4 May 1964 HQS representatives raised with ANYUM-19 the question if AMBIDDY-1 in his own mind accepts the premise of independence from KUBARK control in his management of ANWORLD affairs. AMYUM-19 replied that AMBIDDY-1 had not always done so, but had now become convinced that he was in de facto control of ANWORLD. Commenting upon that fact, AMBIDDY-1 had recently remarked that he now thought he could, if he so decided, fire sic7both ANJAVA-4 and ANYUN-18 without KUBARK attempting to gainsay him.

2. The arrival of James ZABOTH on the scene had at first re-kindled ANBIDDY-1's suspicions that KUBARK may after all try to clamp tight controls upon his operations. However, ZABOTH'S general approach had disarmed those suspicions and convinced AMBIDDY-1 that he is in fact master of his destiny. ANYUK-19 reminisced that AMBIDDY-1 had in the beginning suspected him and AMJAVA-4 as being KUBARK plants. AMYUM-19 added he wanted to be quite candid in telling us that he would not himself have accepted a position in AMWORLD had he entertained the slightest doubts as to the sincerity of KUBARK's promise of autonomy.

3. To re-emphasized our adherence to the principles of autonomy, witness our desire to disengage from extensive involve ment in ANWORLD logistics, our non-interference in personnel matters (except where overriding ODYOKE security interests are involved) and our future handling of bubsidy payments.

4. Comment: We found no reason for disbelieving AMYUM-19' acceptance of autonomy as the principle guiding our mole in ANWORLD. As an aside, AHYUM-19 observed that AMBIDDY-1 should not be expected to subordinate himself to PRPRIZE controls of any kind once FORUMS bad been liberated and we allowed that this was likely to be the case.

ANWORLD Meeting in San Juan, P.R., 2-5 May 1964

SUBJECT: Cackling Over Unlaid Eggs

1.  AMYUM-19 confided to us that ANBIDDY-1 had, prior to the launching of Operation ZENON, prepared a "three and one half page" news release which laid exaggerated claim to damages inflicted during the raid on Santa Cruz del Sur. Only the last sentence stated, more or less as an afterthought, that this should be considered just a minor MRR operation. ANTUM-19 has told AMBIDDY-1 that in his opinion any future announcements should be held down to one or two brief paragraphs.

2.  We pointed out to ANTUM-19 that AMBIDDY-1 was evidently paying no more than lip service to our recommendation that he under-rather than over--play his successes. During the Washington meeting (19-21 March 1964) we had criticized a statement made by AMBIDDY-1 during a Miami press conference to wit: "We do not have enough boats. In one night we can make two trips but not more, but we are doing it. We will fill the country with enough arms to free the country from communism." We took the position that if we were in AMBIDDY-l's shoes we simply wouldn't let on about military matters since this plays into Castro's hands, giving him gratuitous access to military intelligence. AMBIDDY-1 countered by asking us how he could raise the morale of the people without saying anything and without talking about successful ops inside.

3.  We mentioned to AMBIDDY-1 that any vital information not publicized makes the task of Castro's espionage service that more difficult. Besides, things had now come to a pass where little credence was placed in claims of success and promises held out by Cuban exile leaders. What really counted was the demonstrable substance of success inside which speaks for itself. ANBIDDT-1 would be much more effective by preserving a posture of inscrutability. We counselled AMBIDOT-1 to resist a natural tendency to

![image of the word SECRET with a stamp next to it]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 148

SECRET

inflate the significance of his intial successes and to present them in their proper perspective. Me snould refer to those successes as mere appetizers, with the main dish to follow later. This approach rather than the clain of a big victory vould arvase the kind of interest, and in Castro's case, the kind of premonition which carries psychological inpact.

4. We doubt whether AMBIDDT-1 at this stage is prepared to heed our counsel to be conservative in his clains to victory. In the unhealthy climate of competition, engendered by the spectacle of mmerous exile organizations vying to be the first, AKBIDOY-1 may be unable to resist the temptation to broadcast his victories and to exaggerate the damage they have inflicted. Ne vill have to learn the hard way.

# ANWORLD Meeting in San Juan, P. R., 2-5 May 1964

SUBJECT: The Nature of the American Commitment

1. Alluding to certain charges levelled against CIA in
   a recent publication on the Bay of Pigs affair, whose sub-
   stance was that the Cuban military leadership had been served
   with erroneous intel estimates by their CIA advisors, I voiced
   to ANTUM-19 the hope that the U. S. team servicing ANWORLD
   would never be subjected to similar censure (without implying
   justification for charges made in the instance of the Bay of
   Pigs). I reiterated that it was our strong desire to be
   absolutely forthright with our Cuban counterparts, especially in
   stressing that our target intelligence had by its very nature to
   be of limited usefulness, especially when it came to predicting
   the extent and nature of Cuban defense measures. As an example,
   certain radar sites had struck us as highly vulnerable to ex
   ternal raids, but that this estimate might not necessarily be
   borne out if put to the test of an actual operation.

2. In the general content of pacts fulfilled, I once
   more pointed out to ANYUM-19 that the American commitment to
   AMWORLD was a tenuous one and that I would never be able to
   give an estimate of U. S. Government intentions vis-a-vis
   CUBA other than what can be deduced from the events of the
   approaching day. As an example, official American reaction to
   the widening repercussions of a limited AMWORLD success in
   invaliding Cuba was simply unpredictable. ANYUM-19 hastened to
   assure us that AMBIDDY-1 was indeed fully cognizant of the
   circumstances I had outlined and that this sense of urgency in
   commencing operations was partly a reflection of a sense of
   insecurity engendered by the official American posture in
   respect to Cuba.

# CONTACT REPORT # 54

DATE TYPED: 6 Apr. 54

OPERATION: AMWORLD

CONTACT: AMYUM-19

TIME AND PLACE: 0930-1100 Hrs. 4 Apr. 64, S/H 268

NEXT MEETING: Unscheduled

SUMMARY

1. A-19 was asked to provide the Case Officer with a sample of recent AMYUM radio programs. (Comment: P/W requested this. A Station contact is considering producing a "Monitor"-type program, originating in Miami, and broadcast over WRUL. All exile groups would be represented and it would provide a means for special broadcasts such as announcements of any successful AMWORLD ops, etc.

2. Reports from Nacin Elias frequently mention an action group known as "M.L.B", one of whose leaders uses the war name “el Diablo”. A report from Nacin dated 16 March included an appeal for help in exfiltrating "el Diablo" and some others who are in danger. A-19 has heard that six men of the M.IUB. have just come out. One of the men is said to be "el Diablo"( Comment: Confirmed by BARR 1853) After they have been processed and debriefed A-19 will have them debriefed by AMFAST-64 and Alonso. A-19 believes that this group is the source of most of the documents furnished by Macin and are either the only worthwhile contacts of Macin or are completely controlled by the GOC. The latter theory is probably the correct one.

3. A-18 thinks that the captain of the Adelaide will eventually be replaced by Huane if he does not quit f’ret. He is still not exercising the kind of leadership necessary for military pa. This, of course, will necessitate finding a new captain for the Deleres. Of the three crewmen who recently left the Adelaida, two were having difficulties with the rest of the crew and one, Jose Cabesan, left after his brother had been fired by AMBIDDY-1.

4. Quertier asked A-19 if AMWORLD-2 had received a security briefing recently reminding him not to discuss AMWORLD business. A-19 wanted to know if A-2 was still talking too much. The undersigned replied that quite a bit of information pertaining to AMWORLD was coming across his desk and that it appeared to come from AFGWORLD-2. When sufficient details are available it will be called to the attention of the Consejo and AMBIDDY-1, but in the meantime A-19 can remind A-2 to keep quiet about AMWORLD business.

5. Infiltration candidate Pablo Roberto FERNANDEZ Perez, PDOR


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 152

Guantanamo, Oriente Province 7 June 1916 may be identical
with the subject of an AMOT report listing him as candidate
for councilman of Guantanamo City Hall on the PSP slate during
the Grau regime and stating that his son is private secretary
to Carlos Olivares, Undersecretary of Foreign Relations Ministry
of the GOC. A-19 was so informed and was asked to have and
investigation made, taking into consideretion both the CI and
operational leads aspects of the matter.

6. Aida PEREZ Pozo. Guertler asked what her function was with
   AMWORLD. A-19 admitted that he was surprised to see her name on
   the payroll. She is working with Mole in intelligence. She
   has all the lesbian contacts in the city and knows everything
   that goes on. Nothing can be done about it because she is another
   "woman of confidence of AMBIDDY-1,

7. The Case Officer brought up the matter of telephone security,
   the possibility that A-19's private line and his hope phone
   could be tapped, and suggested the use of pay phones for operational
   calls, especially to the Consejo. In order to make use of direct
   dialing A-19 could call the Consejo giving his number and await
   the return call. (The Consejo might want to bring this up with
   A-1) According to A-19 Mole's group is monitoring all calls to
   AMYUM headquarters but he does not think his private line (the
   one used by GUERTLER) is monitored. In reply to the Case Officer's
   question A-19 said that A-l does his business calls from his home,
   1.c. the house of his mistress. The Case Officer commented that
   this fact was known to another group (unspecified) and let the
   Batter drop.

0. The reason for the blown AMYUM safe house: While the AMYUNS
   were on the roof stringing the antenna one of then drove his
   car onto the lawn of the neighbor so that it would be in the
   shade of the neighbors tree. Naturally the neighbor came out
   to see what was going on. He did see. As A-19 #aid, when he
   learned of the incident he had to laugh (albeit somewhat hysterically)
   The only alternative would be to kill the idiot. Guertler agreed.
   We can only hope that the next safe house will be bery isolated.

# CONTACT REPORT # 55

OPERATION: AMWORLD

CONTACT: AMYUM-19

DATE TYPED: 7 Apr 64

TIME AND PLACE: 1500-1630 Hre., 6 Apr 64, S/H

SUMMARY

1. Attached are two recent reports covering the activities
   of Jose Elias aka Nacin. The Habana contact, Bernardo Nievares
   has informed AMYUM that if he can be picked up he will be able
   to come to the WAVE area for about 15 days for debriefing and
   training. The Ramon Mondejar Cid, aka "el diablo" mentioned as
   having been released by the G-2 and waiting for exfiltration iso
   currently in the WAVE area, having escaped with four others.
   According to A-19 they have been interviewed by DURGE and were
   told to have no contact with any other PBRUMEN groups because
   they could receive special training and be sent back to work
   against AMTHUG. The AMYUN have been debriefing the five for
   several days with the sam idea in mind. GUERTLER will get the
   reports when the debriefings are over. A-19 has not gotten the
   preliminary reports but says Alonso is impressed with Mondejar.
   As for the exfiltration of Nievares AMYUM has no intention of
   attempting it but A-19 is considering offering the opportunity
   to do so to Aldo Vera (see below).

2. Aldo VERA Serafin (201-326634) This subject is a former member
   of the DTI, recently considered for use ir an attempt to defect a
   COC official in Madrid. The AMYUMS consiuer nim a good action
   type and sought him out with the intention of infiltrating him
   and his group into Habana province. He is presently receiving
   special training for the job. Vera's file generally substantiates
   A-19's evaluation of the man. However, local traces do contain
   unsubstantiated accusations that he is a G-2 and that he maintains
   contacts with alleged G-2 agents and informers. An ODEL VY report
   In 1963 said that Vora was engaged in transmitting and receiving
   messages by radio with Cuba. The Case Officer informed A-19 that
   while he had nothing definite to offer by way of proof he had
   some doubts about Vare and cited the above. A-19 says that Vers
   does have radio contact with friends in Habana (voice) and that
   he offered hic radio facilities to AMYUM. Assuming that Vera himself
   is clean, Ar19 was cautioned to have all internal ontacts checked
   out and to obtain a complete report on Vera's plans before making
   any commitments. The undersigned continues to have some reservatione
   but Veravas requested by AMSHAG-1, and A-19 likes him so far.
   Guertler will pursue the matter further at a later reeting.

3. AMLILAC-2 has been told by ODURGE that as long as AMYUM requeste
   peralssion for him to leave the country he will be blackballed.
   1000 previous raporte for reason for blackballing). According to
   A-10 DURCE suggested that if he was to be used he could be taken
   out as a crewman on the Adelaide. A-19 wanted to know if it was
   RUBARK that was keeping him on the list. Guertler pleaded ignorance


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 154

and remarked that it could be for any number of reasons completely unrelated to his past relatiors with KUBARK.

4. 16 PRQ Is were turned over for traces. The various group leaders are continuing to recruit for their groups. The Case Officer suggested that they might employ their time sore profitably by working with what they already have and leave the recruting to AMYUM-23. A-19 agreed that the system had to be changed in fact. It was changed in theory some time ago. Gertler suggested that it would be a lot easier on all concerned to look for people with the qualifications to fill existing slots instead of the present procedure of looking for jobs to give all the volunteers that present themselves.After having screened at least a thousand volunteers we still keep getting PRQs on potential cooks or people for whom no specific job exists but who are considered "very good boys". A-19 agreed. Probably nothing will change.

Re: Report #9

To: AMYUM-19

SUBJECT: ACTIVITIES DEVELOPED BY OUR AGENT MACIN SINCE LAST REPORT DATED MARCH 16 64.

Report of MR. MARIO CASAS WHO WORKS WITH SF-1 IN THE RAILWAY SECTOR OF ORIENTE.

He informs that in Guantanamo, Oriente the railway sector has organised a cell. It is composed of: Pablo Eduardo, Coordinator; Jose Sanchez, Vice (coordinator); Luis, Organisation and Romualdo, Military Coordinator, promising to advise later on who the Treasurer is.

He also advises that railway equipment continues in the same state; breakages, accidents and stoppages at the Sugar Centrals for lack of sugar cane and transport equipment. They continue to move equipment and troops at night in large scale. The opinion is that this movement is merely a bluff.

REPORT OF BERNARDO NIEVARES, OF HAVANA, KNOWN BY BENNY.

Advises he is anxious to have news and instructions from us; states that altho' true that he has made a pact with us, he will not be able to continue under present conditions. Insists it is necessary he be given plans of concrete jobs and instructions he can give the men who are anxious to fight over there; that as long as this does not happen, he feels he is only on the border of activities and while we may be satisfied, he would not like to land anyone (in Cuba) specially under the present circumstances where repression throughout the islandis tremendous.

He insists we be sincere with him and give him replies to these various points: What has the National Direction in Exile of the MRR resolved concerning the "MIR" and its integrated organisations. "What plans will they carry out (his group) in the internal fight for the liberation of Cuba" Secondly: "We urgently need a more effective communication; hoping that you already have the necessary means. On our part, we are already in contact and making arrangements with embassies for the correspondence with Miami.- We'll advise you the results." - Thirdly: "It is necessary that you urgently answer me if we can make contact with the American boats stationed in front of Havana, in order to exfil "DIABLO" and other compatriots who are in such danger". We have the necessary ship to transport them. The boat will give 3 flashes at one minute intervals each with a lapse of 10 to 15 minutes."

"I ask you to try and do what you can to help these brothers in misfortune." Fourth - "On the 13th (March) one of our men, "Michel Adam" left for Lebanon via Mexico with correspondence for the address in Miami". - Fifth - Dr. Gomen' contact has not proved as effective as we had hoped; we have met only twice and nothing else has happened."

REPORT DATED 27 MARCH 1964 RECEIVED FROM OUR AGENT "NACIN"

In a letter dated 27 March 1964 Agent "Nacin" says to SUSPEND THE PRODUCTION OF PASSES FOR THE GUANTANAMO NAVAL BASE, of three colors and with different specifications which were ordered according to samples or patterns he had sent, because the Castro Regime announced that as of i April they would be changed. That as soon as he can obtain the new models he will send them so that 50 copies of each color can be made.

Bernardo NIEVARES, more known as "BENNY", in a report dated 18 March 1964, says that Ramon MONDEJAR Cid, known as "EL DIABLO has been set free, together with four other men who were arrested with him, and now all five have been relieved of all activity for security reasons and are waiting in Havana to leave the country.

He adds that if there is a delay in complying with the promise of getting them out of Cuba, he will have to do it himself.

He also reports that Michel ADAM was able to leave Cuba through the Lebanese Embassy, where he took refuge, and is now at the following address: "HORAT YADICHI MIGDALYA, Zagarta, Lebanon".

Regarding Intelligence Reports, he save that he could do much more in that respect, but he has to avoid contacting men when he cannot brief on our situation, and the state of desesperation which exists among them in Cuba. From what Nacin sees from Benny's messages, he save that he does not have other orientations to give him, and that he has to continue in the same conditions as he has been until now. He gave that the person who brought that message refuses to establish contacts, and requests to

rapidly answer him because he has to be in Havana early next Saturday and
sc avoiding things to become complicated.

"Benny" also includes two INTELLIGENCE reports dated 20 March 1964 in which he says:

"The Air Force Captain, Remigio GONZALEZ Espinosa, is being actively sought by the G-2. The charges are that he took apart the controls of five "MIG-21's" on 2 March 1364, one dav.before practices, in the town of Mariel, Pinar del Rio Province, provoking the crashing of a "MIG-21" in which the pilot, Captain DOMINGUEZ Blas, and a woman photographer of the "FAR" lost the lives."

CONTACT REPORT #56

OPERATION : AMWORLD DATE TYRED:10 Apr. 64

CONTACT: AMBIDDY-1,AMJAVA-4,AMYUM-19

TIME AND PLACE: 1030-2400 Hrs., 9 Apr. S/H

SUMMARY

1. The Case Officer confirmed that A-1 had definitely decided not to attempt Operation Genesis and will mount Operation Zenon instead. The undersigned agreed that this was a wise decision since the latest reports indicated increasing hostile naval activity in the area, making chances for survival extremely slight, and reminded A-1 of his recent speech in which he stated that AMWORLD propaganda was in support of military operations and not the reverse, hinting that AMBANG would sacrifice his men for the sake of publicity for himself. A military operation, even if it failed completely would not be as harmful as an obvious publicity stunt that cost lives and equipment. A-1 appeared to accept the necessity for postponing Genesis but was obviously disappointed at not being able to land his sharpshooter to take a shot at the guest of honor during the military review.

2. A-1 and A-4 were given the sequence of Q signs to be transmitted during the test run of the signal plan to be used during the op. The Case Officer reminded A-1 to tell his people that the transmissions will come from one of his bases, and to make certain that the captain of the Adelaida has his copy of the key. The writer suggested that A-l merely inform that ship to monitor the frequency and to report to A-l what signals were received and what action would have been taken.

3. Guertler asked that the Consejo be informed of the Q signs to be used by the Adelaida and the intermediate craft and the base. A-4 said that it would be sent up by radio.

4. The writer suggested that the hourly position reports be started right way to be certain that all would function smoothly during the operation. Since around the clock monitoring of the ship's transmissions will interfere with Disneyland communications with other bases a second radio will be required. One of the agent radios will be taken to the base.

5. A-19 has not located a site for the WAVE transmitter. Alonso has several prospects and A=18 will inspect them and inform the Case Officer soonest. In the meantime, Guertler suggested using the AHYUN office since amidst all the confusion it would probably not attract attention. A-4 was also reminded to furnish us with the signal plan for the WAVE/ Nicaragua link. (The plans to communicate with Managua was abandoned. Commo will be with Disneyland

6. The complete operational plan for Zenon was turned over to the Case Officer on 10 Apr. The essentials were cabled to headquarters.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 161

The remainder will follow by Dispatch.

7. Guertler suggested Curaçao as a suitable place for drydocking Adelaida for needed repairs after the operation. A-l demurred, stating that it would be needed for an infiltration op on 3 May. A-19 was told that it was of the utmost importance that the AKL Dolores be provided with a top quality captain and engineer, regardless of cost or nationality, that the equipment was very sensitive and was irreplacable. A-19 stated that it would be a problem, especially the engineer, but that he would do so. Guertler offered no suggestions where to look, merely commenting that now that AMWORLD had made many commercial contacts he should be able to obtain assistance in locating, a good man for the job.

8. The complete crew for the Dolores has not been signed yet. Some of the crew from the Adelaida can fill in while she is in drydock.

9. A-19was told that the Consejo was negoriating for Standard Oil of New Jersey to provide AMWORLD will its fuel on a regular basis and that the company war.ted a letter from some prominent Nicaraguan official stating that this was acceptable to the GON.

10. The Case Officer asked A-19 if AMWORLD-2 had closed his Swiss account for certain.A-19 replied yes. The writer then told him that that was good because the $25,000 used to open the accound would be refunded to A-2 and that instead of returning it to the Consejo they could keep it and we would deduct the amount from the next month's budget (they have spent most of it already). Shocked looks around the table. They have already spent most of it. It was included in the unexpended assets reported three months ago and was deducted fucceeding month's deposit. Henry said we could spend it. The writer professed surprise since this money was not allocated to the project but was only to be used to keep the account open. This lead to a series of complaints about PBPRIME business methods, the fact that Ramsay Scarlet has recently billed them for $30,000 for something incurred in November, and was that any way to run a business. The writer commented that they just didn't understand anglo-saxon psychology and called it an evening, wishing them the best of luck on their operation.

This will be discussed with A-1 later, after the operation.

# CONTACT REPORT # 57

DATE TYPED: 14 Apr. 64

OPERATION: AMWORLD

CONTACT: AMYUM-19

TIME AND PLACE: 1500-1630, 13 Apr. 64, S/H

SUMMARY

1. 22 PRQ Is turned over for traces.

2. As per UFGW-3513 A-19 was reminded that in the future it was absolutely necessary that the AMWORLD monthly accounting be received on time, otherwise our payments may be delayed.

3. Payroll changes: Guertler discussed the payroll changes noted in UFGW-3490. The two crewmen mentic..ed were terminated for being AWOL but were carriad for two months befcre being told that they would not be given another chance. Ine two examples cited for pay increases are explained by the fact that while the two man were still in the WAVE area they received no family allotment. They are not at the camps and so are being paid more. A-19 was reminded that the insurance, forms must be submitted in order for an AMWORLDER to be covered and that if a person is terminated all coverage ceases and will not be resumed automatically if the person is re-hired. A-19 says he understands this perfectly and will keep us up up to date on all hirings and firings.

4. A-19 was reminded that some of the PRQ Is submitted for traces are unnecessarily vague, citing the case of one submitted from Puerto Rico on Oscar RODRIGUEZ Fernandez. The subjects record of employment lists "Secret Police" without indicating when or for what government.

5. The Case Officer told A-19 that the Consejo had learded that Captain Reinaldo BLANCO and Gustavo de los REYES may wish to contact AMBIDDY-1 and that they might prove useful and should be given a hearing. A-19 replied that BLANCO had been trying to see him for two weeks but that he had been stalling because he did not know what he could do with him at this stage of the project. The Case Officer recommended that he should be given a chance since he might prove useful in the future. A-19 said that he would get in touch with him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 163

6. Guertler asked A-19 if he knew the circumstances surrounding the case of Blas COMAS Castro, captain of a JURE boat reported to be in trouble after having received a letter from AMBIDDY-1 thanking him for signing up for AMWORLD. A-19 said that he would check, but as far as he knew the man must have filled out a form, and that it was not a frameup.

7. Ramon MONDEJAR Cid and the other members of the M.I.D. recently arrived from Habana have been completely debriefed by the AMYUM intelligence section. Very little was revealed by them during their processing at the Refugee Center, but they have been very cooperative with the AMYUMS. They have been kept isolated from the rest of the PBRUMEN community with the intention of training them and sending them back. A-19 would like to use Aldo VERA Serafin's group to reinfiltrate this group and pick up the Habana coordinator, Barnardo NIEVARES, Now that Nacin is not available, having been kicked out of YOACRE (at KUBARK request, according to A-19) the AMYUMS have no way to contact NIEVARES. A-19 mentioned using his embassy contacts to do this, but the writer strongly urged him to keep this group completely compartimented from any other groups. So far MONDEJAR has made a very favorable impression on his intervi vers but very little is known about the coordinator, Benny NIEVARE:. Guertler suggested that A-19 should have these people questioned about wh: they know of NIEVARES, the circumstances surrounding their recruitment. This group was sent with the specific mission of contacting AMBIDDY-1 and asking for material help. From what is known of this organization it seens quite likely to be a provocation, and ar A-19 admits, these people are either unusually competent or completely controlled. A-19 wants to put then to the test by providing them with sab material and asking them to hit a specific target before discussing the matter of further financial or, material aid.

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with AMBIDDY-1, 9 April 1964,
1315 hours

1. The following was relayed to AMBIDDY-1: "We are
   glad you have second thoughts about Playa Giron. We have
   received more information about military, expecially maritime,
   build-up in that sector which would make any landing attempt
   virtually suicidal." AMBIDDY-1 stated he would confer with
   AMJAVA-4 and AMYUM-19 and give us his final decision as to
   whether or not this operation would be run. AMBIDDY-1 commented
   that one life meant more to him than the entire operation. How-
   ever, A-1 again reminded this office of the impact an attack
   on Playa Giron on the 17th of April would have on the morale
   of the Cuban people. The undersigned replied that there are
   two sides to the coin; should their operation fail, this would
   play into the hands of Castro, and it was the opinion of this
   office that the alternate plan would also do much to raise the
   morale of the Cuban people.

2. In conclusion it was reaffirmed to A-l that the
   final decision is his. He replied that after his meeting
   with AMJAVA-4 and AMYUM-19 he will let us know the final
   decision.

2. Concerning the DC-3, A-1 stated that Marmel Hernandez had talked to Petrosky. Petrosky did send a letter to Talaria instead of Carrillo as A-1 had informed this office before. A-1 will get a complete story from Hernandez upon arrival in Costa Rica. A-1 was advised to move the DC-3 to Panama under some pretext before Talaria notifies Carrillo of the cancellation of the charter. The logic behind this is should Carrillo decide to cause some trouble it would be difficult for the DC-3 to leave Costa Rica.

SOURCE: A Cuban exile observer who was present during the speech.

Headquarters Comment. The following is a résumé of the political philosophy of Manuel Artime Buesa, leader of the Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revolutionary Recovery) as prepared by Source. It is based on statements made by Artime in his speech on 18 March 1964 to the Associación para Recuperación Económica de Cuba (AREC, Association for Economic Recovery of Cuba), on his first publication entitled Comunismo por qué? (Communism cor what?), which was written nine months before Castro came to power, and on Artime's book Traición (Betrayal).

1.  Artime does not believe in political extremes - neither the left nor the right. He believes that extremes always end by touching one another. If any extreme gains power in Cuba, and in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship, he will continue to fight with weapons in hand. Artime does not believe in the classification of men by race, by political ranks in former governments, or by money. He confesses to being an opportunist in the sense that he is taking maximum advantage of each opportunity, but not in the sense of changing his beliefs in accord with opportunities.

2.  The main theme of Comunismo por qué? was that more than a change in government a change in the conscience of men is needed. It outlined the duties of the padrón (landowner) toward the workers so that the latter may live in dignity and honor. The padron should feel that the problems of his workers are also his problems. The worker, in turn, has certain obligations to the padron. this *quid pro quo* is not adhered to, a (Christian) government has the right to intervene for the common good. In his letter of resignation to Fidel Castre accusing the latter of being a

Communist and traitor, Artime mentioned that he resigned because Castro had not been honest with the businessmen by not telling then their property would be confiscated.

3. The following excerpts from Artime's book Traicion clearly outline Artime's ideology:

a. "We believe the state should foment and stimulate private economy, both national and foreign. We have to have an effective democracy in Latin America because the word democracy in that area has been prostituted too often. Many countries call themselves democratic but in reality are nothing but militarist and demagogic, and many simply go through the motions of elections. Many are simply totalitarian governments which are living off the blood and toil of the people. The corrupt politicians, the strong men, the totalitarians have been the strongest allies of Communism. Our fight is not against one man, it is not a war of personal hatred--it is a war against the doctrine of hatred, be it called Castro or what have you--it is a war against a doctrine; we are as much opposed to Khrushchev as we are against Tito. We are as much opposed to the totalitarian left as we are opposed to the fascist right"

b. "We don't care if they call us extremist. They will continue to call us rightist or leftist, fascist, philocommunist. I recall the words of Don Quixote when he was passing on the outskirts of a small town and Sancho said to Don Quixote, 'Sir, the dogs are barking at us,' Don Quixote replied, Let them, Sancho, if they are barking it is because we are moving. And we will continue to move.'"

c. "They say we are very ambitious. Our ambition is that in the coming days when Cuba is liberated people will pronounce our name with respect in our country."

d. "Our men in Cuba are not only fighting for the independence of our country but also for the independence of the American hemisphere, for the survival of Christian principles in America, for the Western world." Artime maintains that the situation today is much the way Lenin would have hoped for. Britain and France have recognized Red China; the U.S. is at odds with these two governments--this is exactly what Lenin would have wanted. Artime has supported his statements, by quoting Lenin, "Within 30 years we will embark on a peace ortensive, of coexistence, and we will split the free nations and smash the impotent bourgeois."

e. "The battle-ground for Latin America lies 30 miles from our shores. Should the Western world lose this battle, the sleeping giant (Latin America) will wake up on the side of the Communist camp. Then it would be preferable to be dead because the free world will have coased to be."

2. "We are all guilty for having turned over Cube, to the hands of men who could not govern her properly. We have knocked on doors and will continue to do so because our cause 18 honorable. We cannot afford to wait for miracles. We must prepare for a long fight and not expect the aid of such organizations as the OAS and the UN. It is up to the Cubans to liberate Cuba. If we are not going to wage a war of principles, I will not join that struggle."

2. Proof of the pudding was in the plan presented by AMBIDDY-1 and ANJAVA-4 on 28 March in Miami, which envisions a raid on PBRUMEN about mid-April. The good results of the JMWAVE training sessions were readily apparent in the quality of this plan.

20 Mar 64

SUBJECT: Appearance of Manuel ARTIE Buesa at the A.R.E.C. Session on 18 Mar 64 in the Everglades Hotel, Miami.

At exactly 1550 hours, 18 Mar 64, Manuel ARTIME Buesa appeared before A.R.E.C. members. ARTDB spoke for one hour and twenty minutes, finishing his speech at 1710 hours. During that time he answered questions from the audience.

ARTIME dedicated the first hour of his speech to "presenting his credentials" (that is how he called what he was going to say). During that hour he gave a recount of his actions, beginning with the letter of resignation which he sent to Fidel CASTRO in Cuba, and then reading excerpts from things published in exile by the M.R.R. and from his "Political Testament" which he claimed to have written in the Guatemala training base in the 24 hours preceding the departure for the Bay of Pigs invasion, etc., etc., up to the present time. He finished that part of his speech by da laring that he respected the Constitution of 1940, that he was fighting against a system not against one man, and that he would continue to fight after the fall of Fidel CASTRO Rus if another dictatorship ware established in Cuba-either a rightist or a leftist dictatorship-or if it was simply an at ampt to exchange Fidel for another person, no matter who it might be.

Then he said that many porsons said he was an extrema rightist and others said he was an extreme leftist, that oth said he was an ambitious individual, and others said he was an opportunist. That all he could answer to those who said he was an extremist was that he did not like extremes, either of the right or left, because these extremos alwaye ended by touching each other. That to the who said he was an ambitious individual he replied that yes, he was ambitious, but that his ambition was for his name to be spoken with respect soms day in his countzy That he had the ambition that at least, after his death, it would be saids He was a worthy man. That, in short, what he had was a great ambition for History. That to those who said he was an opportunist he could saya "If opportunism is making use of every moment and every opportunity to do something for the country. I am an opportunist. If opportuniam is

changing ideas in accordance with this or that situation, then I am not an opportunist because I do not change my ideas. I have upheld the same ideas since I appeared in the public light, and they are here in my Political Testament and in other declarations and docurants which I have made and written. For those reasons I cannot be an opportunist."

He also said that he had knocked, was knocking and would continue to knock on all doors to get assistance for the liberation of Cuba. That he classified man into two categories only, worthy men and unworthy men, and there were no other differences. That to him are men were equal, be they black or white, rich or poor, members of one regime or of another. That he has known and knows many worthy men from all regimes, etc., etc., etc.

Questions and Answerss

Following are some of the most outstanding questions and answers:

Questions: A man who said he was named Filiberto RIVERO and that he worked for a TV station at Los Angeles, California, asked the following question. "Mr. ARTIME, I am going to ask you a strong question which therefore requires a previous explanation. Some time ago one of your representatives in Los Angeles told me you would be going to that city and I was going to ask you this question, but you did not go. Now that I have the opportunity I am going to ask this question to you. The question is thiss in Los Angeles and other places there are rumors that in certain U.S. circles, which are described as extreme liberals, they have the plan of using some Cubans-like you, for example--to keep the rest of the Cubans entertained making thea think they will go to war when the feat is that their plan is very different. The plan consists of not having that war and timus be able to show, in a few years, how peaceful coexistence is possible. My question is thiss Have you ever considered that you might be the Cuban who has been chosen for this and that you might still not be aware of it?

Answer: I don't know whether such a plan exists or not, what I can guarantee to you is that I would not be the Cuban chosen for that. I am precisely supported by the group which is opposed to those liberals, by the group of Latin American men who fear just that, not by the U.S.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 181

Report # DD-742, C-4, 20 Mar 64 (cont.)

but by the countries of those Latin Americans. I am a Latin American product, not another kind of product. I am receiving help from Latin America and that is why I cannot be chosen for that plan. Maybe others are being selected for that. (Ovation.)

Questions: A lady in the audience, not a member of A.R.E.C., who said she was a teacher from Las Villas province, Cuba, asked the next question. She began by saying in brief words the help which she had given to insurgents in Las Villas province, etc., etc., and that she had had to leave Cuba because three of her boys had been executed. Then she asked ARTIME: "Why isn't help given to those insurgents?"

Answers: ARTIME said that he did not understand Americans. Then he said that last week, precisaly last week, help had been sent to those insurgents. That unfortunately it was not all that it should be, but it was something. He explained that it is necessary to use small and fast boats and for that reason heavy cargoes cannot be taken, and that it is only possible to make two trips in one night to the Cuban coast and for that reason the help cannot be more effective. That at any rate, they were infiltrating arms, shoes, boots, food and technicians in the handling of armament. He clarified that the function of the technicians was to teach the handling of weapons to the peasants and also to unite them. ARTIME then told the same lady that the porson for whom she was asking was precisely where he could help those over there, and for that reason was not in that room. (He was referring to a person for whom the lady had inquired when he accompanied her from the seat to the microphone, as the lady spoke very softly and the audience asked her to go to the microphone to ask her question so all could hear her.)

Questions: Another member of the audience asked the following questions: "Mr. ARTIME, we understand through announcements that have been published that Mr. RAY or JURE will go to Cuba in the coming months, and there are rumors about another organization doing the same thing. Are you thinking in some action of that type to counteract the effects of those possible actions, in favor of your movement?"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 182

SECRET

Report # DD-742, C-4, 20 Mar 64 (cont.)

Answer: ARTIME gave the following answers: "If they go to Cuba, may God be with them. But I hope it won't be a demagogic action in which men will die to give prestige to others. Let me tell you that we don't make public what we do or plan to do. Some people want publicity for their actions, but we put the liberation of Cuba before publicity."

Comments: In the reporting agent's opinion, nothing new was said in this public appearance. The "presentation of credentials" was already too well known to the audience. The only thing which called attention was his clear position of opposing any maneuver to try to impose a "Fidelismo without Fidel" which the majority of the audience interpreted as meaning Manuel RAY Rivero. Even though ARTIME did not name RAY, his implications were quite clear the same as the look on his face when he was asked something in connection with JURE.

FROM:

SUBJECT: Manuel Artime Buesa's appearance before A.R.E.C. on Wednesday, 18 March 1964.

SOURCE: Report from our collaborator through direct observation.

Following is a literal transcription of the report from our collaborator:

"At 3:30 PM, 18 Mar 64, the A.R.E.C. Recording Secretary, Ignacio CANCIO, read the minutes of the preceding A.R.E.C. session in the conference room of the Everglades Hotel, Miami. The minutes were unanimously accepted by the A.R.E.C. members present.

"Abel Mestre, A.R.E.C. President, announced that the agenda included Dr. Manuel Artime as guest speaker at 4 PM. Then the stand was taken by Gerardo Ariscal who gave a detailed report on the experiences of the newspaperman John Cord (I am not sure of his patronymic because I only heard it spoken), from Life magazine, on his trips around the world.

"At 3:50 PM Abel Mestre announced that Dr. Artime had just arrived and the audience gave him a standing ovation. It is estimated that there were about 500 persons in the audience.

"According to Francisco Prieto, who is one of the most active members of A.R.E.C., this was the A.R.E.C. gathering ever attended by the largest number of persons because the normal audience is from 220 to 240 persons.

"There were from 40 to 45 members of the M.R.R. in the audience, and they could perfectly identified as such because they had the emblem of that organization in the buttonhole of their lapels.

"Artime began his speech by making a recount of his activities since 1959, which he called his 'credentials to A.R.E.C.' He mentioned his letter of resignation to Castro six months after the establishment of the CASTRO Government, where he said to Castro among other things that he should not deceive the industrialists, merchants and live classes of the nation because when industry, commerce and all private properties passed to the hands of the State that would be Communist. Later read some paragraphs from the book which he published in exile prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 184

Report (I-22-945, C-27, 23 May 64 (CONFIDENTIAL)

"ARTIME said this is ambitious man because, since we are on Cuban soil, he wants there to be talk everywhere about him and the liberation of Cuba."

"That some persons accuse him of being a *rightist*, others of being a leftist, and others of being an opportunist. That persons who work in favor of collective interests always have detractors. To those who accuse him of being an opportunist, he says that if using some opportunity in benefit of the freedom of Cuba is being an opportunist, than he is the first opportunist."

"ARTIME said that previous Cuban rulers had had their mistakes, that when the Constitution of 1940 had been written it had also had its mistakes, but as it functioned merely we don't know what those mistakes are. For that reason, until the Cuban people give themselves another Constitution our sole goal upon our arrival at Free Cuba should be to enforce the Constitution of 1940."

"He spoke of the Cuban Caso in the international field, in the sense that he does not understand the attitude of the U.S. or of the rest of the Latin American countries which are allowing their fields to be taken by Castro-Communist guerrillas. ARTIME mentioned that he has not the slightest hope the O.A.S. will do something in benefit of Cuba."

"A lady from the audience who said she was a teacher from Encrucijada, Las Villas province, asked ARTIME why help was not given to her young students who were fighting in Las Villas province without shoes, food or ammunition. She also mentioned that some days ago five of her young boys were executed, including a minor."

"When ARTIME went down among the audience to accompany this lady to the microphone, she whispered a name to ARTIME but the audience could not catch the name. ARTIME replied: 'You have mentioned a name who is not now in this room because he is helping in the liberation of Cuba. He is one of my greatest helpers.' However, ARTIME did not mention the name either."

"ARTIME then said that help is being given to the freedom fighters in Cuba, but that he has very few boats and the boats which go to the

Cuban coast have to be light boats and change every large ships
That not only rifles are needed, but also boats, food and other things
which they (C.R.E.) are now gradually applying.

"One of the A.N.R.C. guests in the audience, an unidentified man, asked ARTIME whether it might not be possible that the U.S. Government were using him as an instrument trying to a policy of national commissioness with the USSR, and that he were just cautious need to keep people entertaining with the Cuban case, naturally, without this being known to ARTIME himself."

ARTIME immediately replied that that might be possible because he did not know U.S. policy plans in that respect, but that naturally, if this were confirmed it was certain he would not lend himself to that maneuver.

"ARTIME continued making general considerations about the Cuban military might, and he described Cuba as the 7th country of the world in the aspect of military power. He continued with a comparison between the men who wage war against CASTRO and the Cuban Government, and the story of the giant Goliath represented by CASTRO and the boy David represented by the clamorous engaging in war activities against CASTRO."

"ARTIME closed by saying that war is the only way of uniting all Cubans and he mentioned that that union had already been achieved at the Bay of Pigs where the blood of Cubans from all ideologies and social classes was mixed."

"ARTIME was questioned about the information appearing in different news media about Junta
![unreadable inscription]
undergoing being in Cuba fighting before the 20th of May, and he replied: 'May God be with them, but we shall never accept any Government of the extreme right, and much less of the extreme left, and in that case we shall continue fighting with the rifle in our hand.' When he finished saying this the audience gave him a standing ovation."

"The event ended with disquieted precipitation because there were rumors in the conference room that Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz would arrive to ask questions to ARTIME about his past with CASTRO with the intention of ridiculing ARTIME. (Incidentally, ANRC gatherings usually end at 6 PM and this one ended at 5 PM.) And in effect, Diaz Lanz arrived at 8:30 PM but the event was already over. Even ANRC President Irizarry was

SUBJECT: Opinions about Manuel ARTIME Buesa's TV appearance on
Sunday, 29 Mar 64.

1. Marcos RODRIGUEZ Menéndez, H.D.C. Executives:

ARTIME showed true leadership qualities. It was a blessing
for lawyers when he referred to the 1940 Constitution. He was very
good when he said that he was for unity and called all Cubans to war
without making any differences among them for their tendencies.

2. José Antonio VALLE (mat. unk.), Miami News distribution manager,
   attorney, mine owner in Oriente province:

ARTIME is a fake and an egotist, but he is a genius in politics.
He scored a win when he said that he did not have time to answer on a
political basis because they were at war. RAY and ARTIME are fighting
for their future in Cuba. They must be left alone until the Cuban problem
is solved because I don't know which of the two is worse.

3. Angel HERNANDEZ Rojo, member of the D.R.E.:

ARTIME is a "yes man" who does not have his own opinion about
what he wants and he unconditionally subjected to the "dollar" without
caring for anything else. The D.R.E. has something ponding with ARTIME
because on one occasion, prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion, he took
over a base which the D.R.E. had in Puerto Rico.

4. Jaime MARZOL Morales, president of "Triunfo" sugar mill,
   resides at 3670 SW 25th St., Miami:

ARTIME was very good. The people liked him as they think he
will lead them to war and that is what everyone wants. His statements
about the 1940 Constitution were very good.

5. Luis ORTEGA sierra, newspaperman:

ARTIME is the man chosen by the C.I.A. to create an internal
problem in Cuba and open the doors for an invest

A-1 commented it was both his and the engineer's opinion that the job could be done rapidly and well. A-l was requested to forward a copy to us of the engineer's proposal for our perusal.

This does not preclude using other cities in the country or in the world for buying and shipping.. However, New York is the best point of control for this activity. The simplest and most efficient way to buy and ship is to determine exactly what is needed and the frequency with which it is to be delivered. Once the list of requirements is drawn up, it should be given to Chester or Zweifach specifying the exact recurring dates of delivery. There is no need for

A-l's people to waste their time on such things as buying, shipping, getting export licenses, etc. This can all be turned over to professional businessmen, thereby relieving you of all burdens.

4. A-1 then commented that in certain cases Mr. King has been able to purchase some items cheaper than Mr. Zweifach. A-1 was informed that in some specific instances this may be the case. However, in large quantities of a recurring nature a professional company will in the long run obtain better rates and render better services than an individual. Also A-1 was reminded that the professional service and efficiency of delivery cannot be duplicated by individuals. A-1 was advised that King could best be used as an adviser and/or consultant to the professional companies doing the work.

5. A-1 was requested to make certain that A-19 clarify to GUTIERREZ and NAVARRETE that there may have been some misunderstanding on their part that Chester was receiving instructions from someone else.

6. A-1 was requested to return the insurance applications of all personnel he no longer has in his employ.

7. The conversation ended with the usual abrazos.

SUBJECT/TYPIC/AMWORLD/Operational
Evaluation of AMBIDDY-1's Training During Period 6 to 18 January 1964

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
ACTION REQUIRED: None; for your information and files.

1. INTRODUCTION: In the period 6 to 18 January 1964, AMBIDDY-1 was given 83 hours of tutorial training, in JMWAVE safe- house facilities, on existing operational doctrine and management techniques applicable to a major clandestine effort against PBRUMEN. A copy of the training schedule which was used in this tutorial training is attached. At the completion of the training course, the various training instructors submitted an evaluation on AMBIDDY-1. These evaluations are outlined in the following paragraph.

2. EVALUATIONS: The below-listed evaluations were prepared by the instructors who participated primarily in Phase I of AMBIDDY-1's tutorial training. The Phase I instruction concentrated on imparting to AMBIDDY-1 current operational doctrine relative to unconventional warfare techniques. The evaluations are as follows:

a. Small Unit Operations and Training: AMBIDDY-1 responded most enthusiastically to all aspects of the training on small unit techniques. He made detailed notes on the material covered, and these notes included copies of training charts and diagrams. AMBIDDY-1 displayed particularly intensive interest in that portion of the training dealing with the principles of survival and the issuance of individual equipment. In the course of the training, AMBIDDY-1 was given several practical tactical problems to solve. AMBIDDY-1's solutions to these problems were logical and reflected a grasp of the techniques to which he had been exposed during the training sessions. Thomas L. DARGUZIS was the primary instructor in this phase of the training, and he assessed AMBIDDY-1 as being an intelligent, alert, highly-motivated individual who has a realistic appraisal of his own limitations and capabilities.

b. Clandestine Activity: AMBIDDY-1 received extensive training in tradecraft subjects, including the nature and elements of clandestine activity, security, cover, compartmentation,

organization of a basic net, communications and reporting techniques. In the course of this training, AMBIDDY-1 expressed a particular interest in the subjects of security, cover and compartmentation. Charles F. MASENGILL was the primary instructor for this bloc of training, and he reports that AMEIDDY-1 was a keen student who appreciated the opportunity to learn as much as possible about clandestine operations. MASENGILL believes that AMBIDDY-1 at the completion of his training was probably weakest on the topic of how to report intelligence information.

c. Resistance Activity and Guerrilla Warfare: AMBIDDY-1 received training on the principles and concepts inherent in organizing an infiltration team. In addition, he was trained relative to the principles of organizing a resistance net. Additionally, he was trained in caching, demolition and sabotage techniques. AMBIDDY-1 also received instruction in the principles and concepts of guerrilla warfare. AMBIDDY-1 was also given an opportunity to familiarize himself, through actual range firing, with those weapons which are normally used by anti-AMTHUG-1 forces. Alton T. PIRNACK was the principal instructor for this bloc of training. PIRNACK reports that AMBIDDY-1 was responsive to the subject material which was presented to him. AMBIDDY-1 did not hesitate to ask questions nor to seek clarification of points which he did not clearly understand. AMBIDDY-1 did indicate that he was a neophyte in the subject of PM operations, and, as a result, he was most appreciative of the training which he was receiving on these subjects. It was evident during this bloc of training that caching was an entirely new facet of clandestine operations for AMBIDDY-1.

3. COMMENT: Phase II of AMBIDDY-1's training concentrated on exposing AMBIDDY-1 to those management techniques and principles which are applicable to a major clandestine operation against a target like PBRUMEN. This part of the training was carried out exclusively by Andrew K. REUTEMAN and Stanley R. ZAMKA. In this phase of the training, AMBIDDY-1 constantly expressed a great deal of enthusiasm for the subject material which was being presented. Throughout the training, AMBIDDY-1 gave every indication that he was absorbing the major portion of the training. At the same time, it was clear that he was overwhelmed by the material and the implications of what this training meant in terms of his conduct in future operations. After the management phase of AMBIDDY-1's training was completed, REUTEMAN and ZAMKA reviewed the 83 hours training program in its totality with AMBIDDY-1. In addition, the program was reviewed with all of the instructors who participated in the training. As a result of this review, a consensus was reached that, while AMBIDDY-1 is an intelligent and responsive student, the training which he received does not qualify him for the position of senior officer in a major clandestine undertaking against PBRUMEN, The training did, however, alert AMBIDDY-1 to a number of problems and pitfalls which he should avoid in his activities. This training also provided certain guide posts for AMBIDDY-1, but these guide posts were laid out in such a concentrated dose that they cannot be considered as an adequate substitute for experience or training in depth over an extended period of time.

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and
Martin Ferrer

DATE : 1300 hours on 24 March 1964

1.  AMBIDDY-1 telephoned our office to say that the ADELAIDA is leaving today for the free port of Colon to pick' up provisions and to leave three men who are sick. One has a tumor in the neck, the second has a dislocated shoulder, and the third is suffering from stab wounds. A-1 was unable to hospitalize them in Nicaragua because General Somoza felt that this would attract undue attention.

2.  A-1 commented that the provisions which they have to buy will be taken from the March budget.

3.  A-1 has received a report from AMJAVA-4 indicating that there is a need for a general house cleaning as far as personnel is concerned in many of the camps.

4.  A-1 inquired if there was any objection to ADELAIDA leaving for Panama. Martin stated that off hand he could see no objection; however, A-1 should call later in the day for confirmation.

1.  AMBIDDY-1 called to say that AMJAVA-4, who arrived in Miami last night, told him that Alegrett is arriving at 1700 hours today at Miami on *Janicima* Airlines.

2.  Alegrett is bringing with him "movies" which he took of the Puerto Cabezas base (Carlay). While at Carlay taking these pictures, Alegrett stated that he was on official business.

3.  AMBIDDY-1 was concerned that U. S. Customs may take the pictures away from Alegrett when he entered the country. AMBIDDY-1 was told not to worry about the pictures, for after all Carlay is an official Nicaraguan National Guard base. AMBIDDY-1 said that he would try to get an opportunity to see the pictures.

SUBJECT: Operational/TYPIC/AMBANG/ANWORLD Interviews with AMBANG-1 and AMBIDDY-1 in Puerto Rico

ACTION REQUIRED: None; FYI
REFERENCE: UFG-4784 Para. 3

1. The following information, not disseminated, was reported initially to Gordon R. HAWLOTT by AMING-2 on 8 February 1964 following his return from a month's visit to Santo Domingo and Puerto Rico. AMING-2 reported that he had kot separately with AMBIDDY-1 and AMBANG-1 in the apartment of a friend in San Juan, the meetings occurring during the last week of Janary. While HAWLOTT feels that AHING-2 is usually quite reliable and objective on general political reporting, his own participation in exile politics and political ambitions could conceivably influence his objectivity. In an effort to check the accuracy of AMING-2's remarks, the CO again discussed the interviews with AMING-2 on 18 Harch at which time AMING-2 repeated his account of the interview without any change in text, so that the CO is inclined to accept AMING-2's account as generally accurate.

2. During the last week of January AMBANG-1 told Source at a private nmeeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico that he would like to enlist Source's assistance as an advisor on medical affairs and as a propaganda worker. Source, per PBRUMEX custon, requested that AUBANG-1 explain to Source what resources he had for the Liberation of PBRUMEN and asked ANBANG-1 to offer proof why he cheuld consider himself a leader. Source clains AMBANG-1 replied that he had boats and weapons sufficient for strong military.... sction into PREUMEN and would be able to place combat forces in FBRUKEN during March 1964, said combat forces having an ability to hold their own for weeks on the island, AHEG-2 observed that ho had driven out to Mayagues where he had seen four coparate

training installations, one of which was reported to be the property of ANBANG/1. AMBANG,/l replied that be bad training installations on the Florida mainland and had training and logistical bases or a base in Venezuela.

3. Source asked ANBANG/1 what backing he had from World Powers for the invasion of PBRUMEN. AMBANG/1 replied that ho still had significant White House contacts despite the death of John F. Kennedy. He added that he was in contact with top personnel of ODACID and held regular meetings with a very high ranking officer of KUBARK. He stated he also had been introduced by the KUBARKER to the Chief of Operations at YOACRE and was in regular comunication with the ODOATH officer. In general, AMBANG/1 stated, his sources of funds were largely ODYOKE. Source then asked if he was to understand that AMBANG/1 had the approval of ODYOKE for operations into PBRUMEN. AMBANG/1 reportedly replied "I have been given the green light".

4. Around 1 February Source net in San Juan with ANBIDDY/1 for a private talk. ANBIRDY/1 suggested that Source associate himself with AMBIDDY/l's movement in order to help form a post- liberation government. Source replied that he was rather vague as to AMBIDDY/l's plans and backing. AMBIDDY/1 stated that he had been selected by ODYOKE as that PBRUMENER having the necessary leadership and experience for the overthrow of ANTHUG. Source asked if he understood correctly that AMBIDDY/1 was telling him that he had the approval of ODYOKK. If so, why was AMBIDDY/1 drawing support from Venezuela and from Central American Governments. ANBIDDY/1 reportedly replied that he did not actually rely on Venezuela and other Latin American conors for his assistance, since he was receiving all his logistical and financial support from KUBARK. Source stated that he had heard that AKBIDDY/1 was amassing a formidable invasion force in Bicaragua, Costa Rica and Panaman CZ.AMBIDDY/1 replied that he had been given very large suas of money, which proved the reliance which ODYOKE had in him and made obvious the fact that ODTOKE had selected him to bring about the liberation of PBRUNIKI. Source asked why it was that ODYUKE and KUBARK would select AMBIDDY/1 before all others as the means of liberating PERUMEN. AMBIDDY/1 reportedly replied that ODYOKE had selected him because, in the opinion of ODYOKE, be represented the post sane and centrist political concentration among the PBRUKEN exiles and ODTOKE knew that in AMBIDDY/1 it had a leader resolved to maintain erees and centrist democratic governmost in PBRUKEN following the liberation.

3. ASING/3 asked both AMBIDDY/1 and AMBANG/l during his separate interviews with then whether ANBIDDY/1's presence in Puerto Rico signified that the two leaders had met or planned to neot.in an attempt to coordinate their activities. Noither AMBIDDY/1 nor AKBANG/1 denici nor confirmed Source'a questions, but gave evasive answers. Bource therefore assumes that they had not net, but hoped to meet for talka.

# SYNOPSIS OF AMBIDDY-1'S SPEECH TO AREC

18 March 1964

"You will forgive me if before a gathering the Agrupacion de la Reconstruccion Economical de Cuba I do make profound economic or technical analysis of the reconstruction of Cuba, the reason is very simple, it is because I don't know. Inasmuch as I do not like to talk about things which I know nothing of I prefer not to touch upon the suoject. Here at this gathering there are men more capable than I . . . men who will have the difficult task of the reconstruction of Cuba upon their shoulders.

I want to talk about what I know about. But first let me present my credentials. Why the presentation of credentials? When two people speak for the first time the first portion is the presentation and this is the first time I talk with AREC, although I have the pleasure of speaking to some of its members separately and in great lengths. Why this presentation of credentials?

Because I know our movement is very controversdal. They say we are of the extreme right, they say we are of the extreme left, they say we are opportunist and they say we are ambitious. I do not expect to change anyone's mind by this talk. I believe it is my duty to assert certain principles and to mention our beliefs. Not a criteria of profound economic principles : . . I am not an economist nor an expert on the subject. I believe it useful for our movement to accert before this assembly some of its principles


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 211

in which it professes and will continue to profess and for which
we are prepared to give our lives and in some cases already have.
I believe it is our duty to mention them here or anywhere else.

First of all I do not believe in extremes . . neither left nor right. I believe extremes always end by touching one another.

Secondly I want to state that if any extreme comes to power in Cuba, in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship; in both cases we shall continue to fight with our weapons in hand.

Thirdly, I do not believe in the classification of men by race, political levels in the government to which they formerly belonged nor by money . . . I know whites who souls are black and I know blacks who souls are white. I know wealthy men who are spiritually poor and poor who are spiritually wealthy. I only believe in one classification of men and that is the moral classification--men of honor and men without honor. Men who keep their word and those who do not keep their word. . . In this classification I do believe . . .

Are we opportunist? This depends what your definition of opportunist is. If by opportunist you mean taking maximum advantage of each opportunity, then ladies and gentlemen, we are oportunist. In order to save Cuba we have to take maximum advantage of every opportunity. But if by opportunists you mean the man who changes his beliefs in accord with the opportunities, then we are not opportunist."

SECRE

AMBIDDY-1 goes on to mention his various publications. He describes his first publication, *"Communism por que?"* (Communism what for?) which he wrote nine months prior to Castro coming to power. The main theme of this pamphlet, according to A-1, was that more than changing a government what is needed is a change in men's conscience. The pamphlet also outlined the duties of the padron (land owner) to the workers so that the latter may live in dignity and in honor. The patron should feel that the problems of his workers are also his problems. The worker in turn has certain obligations to the patron. If this *quid pro quo* is not adhered to the (Christian) government has the right to intervene for the common good.

Later on, after Castro was in power, A-1 wrote his letter of resignation accusing Castro of being a communist and traitor. In this letter A-1 mentions he resigned because Castro had not been honest with the businessmen by not telling them their property would be confiscated.

A-1 then went into exile and there he published a book called Traiccion (Betrayal). This book clearly outlined the idealogyy of the movement.

"We believe the state should foment and simulate private economy both national as well as in foreign. [During the Bay of Pigs I wrote my political thesis.] We have to have an effective democracy in Latin America. [I say effective democracies because in Latin America] the word democracy has been prostituted too


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 213

often. Many countries call themselves democratic but in reality are nothing but militarist, demagogic, and many simply go through the motions of elections. Many are totalitarian governments which are living off the blood and toil of its people. The corrupt politicians, the strong men, the totalitarian have been the strongest allies of communism. Our fight is not against one man, it is not war of personal hatred :. it is a war against the doctrine of hatred be it called Castro or what have you . . it is a war against a doctrine; we are as much opposed to Khrushchev as we are against Tito. We are as much opposed to the totalitarian left as we are opposed to the fascist right.

"They continue to call us extremist. We don't care. They will continue to call us rightist or leftist, fascist, philo- communist. I recall the words of Don Quixote when he was passing on the outskirts of a small town and Sancho said to Don Quixote, ‘Sir, the dogs are barking at us.’ Don Quixote replied, ‘Let them, Sancho, if they are barking it is because we are moving. And we will continue to move.'"

"They say we are very ambitious. Yes, we are very ambitious. We have an ambition which blinds us and we are disposed to give our lives for that ambition. An ambition for what? That in the coming days when Cuba is liberated people will pronounce our name with respect in our country."

"When our men die in Cuba they are not only fighting for the independence of our country . . . they are fighting for the

![SECRET]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 214

independence of the American Hemisphere, for the survival of Christian principles in America, for the Western world. . . the rest of the Western World." A-l maintains that the situation today is much the way Lenin would have hoped for. Britain and France have recognized Red China; the U. S. is at odds with these two governments. This, A-l maintains, is exactly what Lenin would have wanted. A-1 then quotes Lenin, "Within 30 years we will embark on a peace offensive, of coexistence and we will split the free nations and smash the impotent bourgeois."

"The battle ground for Latin America lies 90 miles from our shores in a place called Cuba. Should the Westend world lose this battle the sleeping giant (Latin America) will wake up on the side of the communist camps. Then it would be preferable to be dead because the free world will have ceased to be."

"We have knocked on many doors. I have one obsession and that is the liberation of my country and if I have to lose my prestige I will do so. God will know I have not lost it. I do not believe that in order to save my country there are bad doors. The only bad doors are the ones that have been closed to us in order to lock Cuba within them."

"We are all to blame. We are all guilty for having turned over Cube into the hands of men who could not govern her properly. This is not the time to cry like women for what we were unable to defend as men. I have knocked on doors and will continue to do so because

my cause is a moral and honorable one and what I ask for is noble. We cannot afford to wait for miracles because only God can create miracles. We must prepare for a long,fight and not expect the aid of such organizations as the OAS, UN. It is up to the Cubans to liberate Cuba. We either have to wage a war of principles or not. If we are not going to wage a war of principles I will not join that struggle.

"The present situation of the case of Cuba. The present state of our homeland. Communism is completely established. We lose daily 10 fighters for freedom. In the cities communism is in complete control. It is necessary for an individual to carry five different credentials in order to travel inside of Cuba. Lack of any one of these credentials brings down the repressive measures of the G-2 until the individual can explain the reason for his missing credentials."

"Guerrillas in the mountains; some resistance groups in the cities; a resentment among the militia because the foreigners have privileges which the militia does not. The campesino who will not accept the communist doctrine and guerrillas in Escambray, Camaguey, which are growing stronger daily. This is the situation in Cuba today."

"The status of Cuba outside of Cuba: The U. S. In the most difficult position and the most unexplainable position of the Western World. I can sum it up in one sentence. I do not understand it. We do not want to be saved by the Marines. Let us make this quite

clear. The Cuban people have always maintained that they are willing to die."

A-1 then alludes to the Alliance for Progress which he refers to as an Alka Seltzer in the Pacific. He maintains he is not against the Alliance for Progress but rather that something should also be done for Cuba.

Question and answer period

Question: I understand that in certain sections of the United States Government there exist ultra liberals who believe that communist Cuba could be used as an experimental ground and in the coming years communist Cuba could be used as a proving ground for the coexistence of the great world powers, that is, Russia and the U. S. The question is Dr. Artime, have you considered deep in your conscience the possibility that the U. S. Government is using you and your movement to occupy the Cubans who wish to liberate their homeland with other activities so that they cannot liberate their country with the force and enthusiasm they desire. The question is have you considered the possibility that you, under your best intentions, are the instrument by which these ultra liberal forces in the U. S. can paralyze the liberating activity of the Cuban people?

Answer: A very good question, If the U. S. were giving me something this might be true but I believe the ones who are receiving aid, possibly other ultra liberals, may be in collusion with the U. S. This is very possible. I can make a mistake. I can make two mistakes but after one has spent two years in jail one cannot be fooled so


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 217

easily, more so when one has been condemned to death. It is possible this plan exists but I do not know since I do not have access to these ultra liberals. It is possible they are looking for someone to do it, this is possible. I can guarantee you one thing. I am not doing this because my power comes fron men who believe as I do, as you do, and who are located south of the Rio Grande. These men are gambling the lives of the people in their own countries. Because they know if they do not help in overthrowing Fidel Castro in less than two years, their own countries will be victims of communism. I am a product of the desperation of the Latin American countries.

Questions Dr. Aftime, how can we unite the Cubans in order to make the cause of those fighting inside felt more deeply?

Answer: Very good question. Very good. A North American friend of mine once said he would rather carry ten cats in a bag than work with two Cubans. I said to him that he was quite right; however, Cubans are not the only ones that are hard to understand. The Latin American is also difficult to understand. Thank God, we are very individualistic and that is why the communists are having such a difficult time. Because we are very individualistic. The war is the only thing which can unite the Cubans. The only thing which can create an unbreakable bond, betweennrich, poor, Negroes, whites, Catholics, Protestants, Mason, everyone, is sacrifice. I do not believe in theoretical unions.

Question: In Miami they say that JURE, Manuel Ray's organization, will make an attack on 20 May or early in June. Would there be any possibility that your movement also intends to do something in the near future. Also, what is the possibility of having a government in arms.

Answer: That is the $64,000 question, If they (JURE) decides to go, may God bless them. And please let it not be a demagogic act to give prestige to others. The only thing I ask God is that He accompany them. I say this with all sincerity. Our strategy is mapped out. What we have done cannot be published. We cannot publicize the arms we have sent into Cuba. We cannot publicize the infiltrations we have made to teach the campesinos about guerrilla warfare. These are things we cannot public. Not that we are enemies of publicity but we cannot subordinate the war to publicity, we are subordinating the interests of_publicity to the war. In a free election I would admit all political theories but by violence I will not admit any extremism. The war may last three years against Fidel and five against communism. It does not matter. We will use violence to deter any extremism.

Question: About five months ago I arrived here thanks to people with great influence. Students of mine were in the Escambray. I took food and medicines to them. I ha 19 girls who helped me gather rosaries and everything in the ways of clothes. There are now 500 students of mine who are now prisoners. Others are being con-

stantly harassed and persecuted. Why aren't we helping these
people?

Answer: There are many, madam, who are now helping. This
week we have sent some aid and arms inside, perhaps not as much as
we would like but sent some. We also have to send not just weapons
but food, shoes, etc. The guerrillan lack everything. The problem
of supplying them is very difficult but we are trying. We do not
have sufficient boats. To arrive at the coast we cannot use large
ships but small beats and these small boats have a limited capacity.
These small boats can only make two trips in one day and no more.
It is being done on a small scale but it is being done. The force
to liberate Cuba is there inside Cuba and it is up to us to assist
them.

Question: Deetor, don't you have any confidence in the OAS.
I refer specifically to the recent cache of arms discovered in
Venezuela?

Answer: I admire the Venezuelan people, I admire Venezuelan
democracy and if a strong measure is taken against Cuba, because of
the just screams of the Venezuelan people and if the OAS listens
to these screams, I will admire the CAS.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Western Hemisphere
Division (Special Affairs)

SUBJECT: ANWORLD--Talk with AMBIDDY-1

AMBIDDY-1 will be meeting with us in the Washington safehouse on 19-20 March. If you can spare the time, it might be helpful if you could have a heart-to-heart talk with him on his relations with Senora Padron, which may be blossoming forth into matrimony. There cannot be much doubt now that she is reputed to have been Fulgencio Batista's mistress and that this fact (if fact it be) is widely known. If he marries her, the political repercussions could be calamitous. It would be helpful if you could tell AMBIDDY-1 point blank that if scandal ensues, this could doom the program.

DATE : 16 March 1964 at 1630

1. AMBIDDY-1 called this office to say that Luis TOMAS Rey and Eladio BAS Trespalacios couldnot sail because they were unable to obtain their re-entry permits. Since these two could not obtain their permits "the people" had told Amado MUNNE Pantaleon that it was not worthwhile for him to go. Martin asked AMBIDDY-1 if any mention had been made concerning TOMAS's skin rash and that he did not see-a doctor. AMBIDDY-1 stated that he had not been so informed by AMYUM-19. AMBIDDY- was asked if the only reason "BAS and TOMAS could not leave was because they could not obtain their re-entry permits. AMBIDDY-1 answered that was the sole reason and that all three wanted to go desperately. AMBIDDY-1 agreed that under any condition MUNNE should go since he is the most important of the three.

2. AMBIDDY-1 would call this office at 1800 in order to receive a more concrete answer to this situation.

3. Martin asked AMBIDDY-1 if the suitcase containing the uniforms had been sent. AMBIDDY-1 does not know. However, he will investigate and if the uniforms have not been sent, AMBIDDY-1 will bring them to the Consejo meeting on 19 March.

A-1 estimated, however, that the total figure may be in the $300,000 category. This is another subject which A-1 would like to discuss in the next meeting.

5. Another topic he wants to discuss is the transfer of the C-47 to Nicaragua.

6. A-1 informed us that "key personnel" are no longer listed on the budget, however, there are individuals which fall into the category of guerrillas and infiltrators who are in Miami and are receiving retainers.

7. A-1 was informed that the propagation charts for the month of April are on their way to him.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation Between AMBIDDY-1 and
Raul Hernandez (as Martin Ferrer)

DATE: 13 March 1964, 1800 hours

1.  AMBIDDY-1 began the conversation by saying that the reason he had been late in checking was that he had been at a meeting with the DMJM engineers. A series of items had been discussed on which A-l would like to have our suggestions. A-1 expressed the desire to meet with the Consejo as soon as possible in order not to give the impression to the DMJM people that he was being masterminded by someone else. Martin explained to A-1 that Henry was currently out of town, but that his request for a meeting would be brought to Henry's attention upon his return. A-1 went on to say that the deadline for the budget to be submitted is close at hand which also adds to the urgency for a meeting.

2.  Martin asked A-1 if he had checked his Post Office box. A-1 replied yes. A-l was then assed to confirm or deny the rumor concerning Santiago Alvarez which alleged that A-1 has given him full autonomy within AMWORLD. A-l said that he has not had a chance to talk to Santiago Alvarez since his return to Miami, but would do so soon. A-l stated, however, that when he had approached Santiago Alvarez, the latter was informed he could bring with him "a mechanic or two," but A-l never authorized Santiago Alvarez to bring his entire group en masse..

3.  A-1 advised that the radio link between Miami and Costa Rica has been established. A-1 was told that there would be no need to obtain a HAM radio license to operate. Should his organization be approached by the local authorities concerning the operation of the radio, they are to plead ignorance of the law and stop transmitting. This information was obtained from Jim Smith.[^7] A-1 mentioned that he had received the dummy

[^7]:

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 225

-2-

message sent to him in Costa Rica, however he did not receive the accompanying message. A-1 was asked to find out why the private link message did not reach him. Also, it was explained to A-1 who "El Narizon" is.

4. A-1 was casually asked if there would be any objection to AMYUM-19 attending any of the Consejo meetings. A-1 had no objections.

5. A-1 has some motion pictures and photographs of the bases and will bring them to the next Consejo meeting.

6. A-1 was informed that a letter from Luis Sierra, chief of the guerrillas, was intercepted by his own people in Miami. This letter contained a photograph with Sierra and other members of the guerrilla teams dressed in their new uniforms. A-l was asked to investigate how this letter had been sent from the base and also how Sierra was able to have the picture developed.

7. This brought up the subject of Manuel Gomez. A-1 said that Gomez will be leaving on Monday, 16 March, for Nicaragua to survey AMWORLD installations. A-l had just a few hours previously spoken to Gomez. In the conversation, Gomez elaborated on the security measures he wishes A-l to take concerning his own security. A-l continues to sing the praises of Gomez. A-1 also commented that he has noticed a marked improvement in the security of his personnel since the last time he was in Miami.

8. While in Costa Rica, A-1 detected being followed by another car. A-1 was able to lose the surveiller. Martin took this opportunity to stress to A-l the need for increasing his personal security measures such as more body guards and more secrecy concerning his movements.

9. The ADELAIDA arrived in Hollywood o/a 8 March. A-1 was not able to examine the contents of the sabotage equipment due to his preoccupation in Costa Rica with the MCRL and Vico Starke. The ADELAIDA onloaded weapons from the barge and sailed for Nicaragua..

10. AMJAVA-4, ANWORLD-2 and "the Mexican" will leave together for Nicaragua on 16 March.

11. А-1 expressed an interest in moving the C-47 out of Costa Rica. A-1 would like to discuss the method of transfer with the Consejo.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 226

-3-

12. A-1 vas told that if it can be done in a secure and discreet manner through some contact, we would appreciate having a list of all Cuban nationals in Costa Rica.

13. Concerning the budget, A-1 would like to discuss this in person rather than through the mail.

14. A-1 said he would keep in close contact with us on a daily basis.

DATE : 12 March 1964, 1000 hours

1.  Martin began the conversation by welcoming A-1 home.

2.  Martin stated that he had a message from Henry which would have been sent out today had A-l still been in Costa Rica. There were a few questions that Henry would like answered:

a. Since the Consejo had no previous indications of Calderonista attempts to overthrow the government, we would appreciate any additional information A-1 might have. A-1 began by saying that Vico Starke had had meetings with Francisco Calderon. Calderon's brother, Rafael, had been very friendly with Vico Starke's brother as of late. Vico Starke's brother had been at GUILLOT ever since the first arrival of the AMWORLD contingent. Rafael Calderon had a meeting in GUILLOT with Vico Starke's brother of an unknown nature. A-1 considers the Calderonistas the main opposition to the government. Other substantiating reports had reached Figuls, the head of security for the Costa Rican Government. Vico Starke had placed old Calderonista elements in key positions within the MCRL. A-1 gave Col. Figuls as his source of information. Vico Starke had wanted to place these old Calderonista elements within the AMWORLD organization in a supervisory capacity and they also would have the final say within AMWORLD.

b. What did A-1 mean by other reports reaching Cornelio Orlich and are you certain Starke not acting in concert with Orlichs. A-1 replied that Cornelio had received other reports through his intelligence section, however, Cornelio had placed very little credence in them. Cornelio visited

Starke confronting his with what he had heard. Vico Starke told Cornelio that what he really wanted was to establish a contraband business mainly dealing ia whisky. Starke also visited A-1 and timidly told A-1 that he was in financial straits and the reason why he had wanted to move MCRL people into key positions was to use the MRR vehicles as a cover mechanism for contraband. Vico Starke told A-1 that he could obtain the approval of the government to engage in this type of business. It appears to A-1 that Vico Starke did present the contraband pro position to Cornelio Orlich and received tacit approval. A-1 informed both. Cornelio and Vico that since it was their country they could do as they pleased, however, he would not permit his vehicles to be used for this purpose. His main concern was to liberate Cuba and not to engage in the internal affairs of Costa Rica. His only desire is to be left alone so he can work effectively.

c. What is Figueres' role in this? A-1 replied that he had not seen any indications that Figueres had been involved. Although he and Vico Starke are close friends, they are political enemies.

d. What were his specific charges against Cabezas?
A-1 stated:

(1) The main charge against Cabezas was his collusion with Vico Starke to subordinate AMWORLD to the MCRL.

(2) Cabezas held a meeting with Vico Starke's brother and Rafael Calderon without authorization or informing A-1.

When A-1 initially confronted Rolando Cabezas, the latter refused to answer any of A-l's questions. At a later meeting Cabezas confessed that the reason why Vico Starke had wanted control of the MRR was for the contraband whisky. A-1 feels that this contraband whisky was just an alibi and the main motive had been to overthrow the Costa Rican Government.

e. Will Vico Starke accept defeat or will he try again to control our movement? A-1 feels that Vico Starke no Longer poses a direct menace to his organization. Starke has been removed as the intermediary to Cornelio Orlich. Starke, however, is still in close contact with Cornelio Orlich. A-1 emphasized that Vico Starke will not be per- mitted to enter the camps, mainly GUILLOT, even though it is on his estate.

f. Has there been an open break between Starke and the Orlichs? A-1 stated that at the beginning of the crisis there had been a break between Starke and Cornelio Orlich, however, Starke has been able to smoothen the rupture by telling Cornelio Orlich that his main interest in controlling the MRR was for financial gains through the contraband trade.

g. Is Cabezas your main source on Starke and Calderon?
A-1 commented that Cabezas had been one of his sources, but also Col. Figuls plus reports given to A-l by his own people in the camps. However, his main source was the facts which speak for themselves.

3. Changing the subject, Martin asked A-1 why he could not go to Guatemala. A-1 explained that what he had wanted to say in his message was that at this particular time Guatemala would have to be ruled out because his passport showed an exit from Mercedes Airport in Nicaragua. However, this did not preclude future meetings in Guatemala. A-l apologized if he had given us the wrong impression in his message.

4. A-1 stated that within the coming week he might want to have a special meeting with the Consejo concerning the latest political developments in Costa Rica.

5. A-l is forwarding us a tape on Honduras and Costa Rica as soon as possible.

6. A-1 is not satisfied with the developments in Nicaragua and with Iglesias in particular. A-l implied that the main problem may be the funding mechanism in Nicaragua and misuse of AMWORLD funds. A-l is sending AMWORLD-2, who is a public accountant, to review the financial situation there.

7. A-1 was asked to service his post office box since there are several letters waiting for him.

8. A-1 expects to meet with the DMJM people, who are now in Miami, along with ANWORLD-2 and AMJAVA-4.

9. It was requested of A-l that he precede any Consejo messages which require immediate attention with the word' "URGENTE" so that members of this office will not needlessly be called at all hours of the night. A-1 agreed.

10. A-1 was reminded that we still have not received AMWORLD-2's report regarding his interview with Eusebio Mujal.

AMWORLD Meeting in New Orleans, 29 Feb to 1 March 1964

SUBJECT: Galley Proofs of Book, "Bay of Pigs"

1. The two chapters of subject galley proofs vere discussed with ANJAVA-4. We called attention particularly to the part referring to "Frank's" discussion of the possible "arrest" of American advisors in case of orders from Washington changing the plan of the invasion. We passed on Mr. Archer's view that A-1 should stick with the story, if it is true, in case reporters should question hin about it, but that we felt that the easiest way out of this matter without building up a new controversy would be to take it fairly lightly. In other words, perhaps we could play it as though it had not been considered serious at the time because it was felt that Frank was a bit of a blowhard anyway who tried to involve himself too deeply in everything... plus the fact that we realized be vas under considerable: strain and probably this was just a brainstorm. A-4 felt that this was a sensible way to handle the matter. He understood it and agreed to discuss the matter with ANBIDDY-1 and felt that this would be acceptable to hin

2. A-4 askel if we had access to the rest of the book. I answered that to my knowledge these were the only two chapters available at the moment. I conjectured that perhaps they were beng proofread, re-written, etc., chapter by chapter and that these were the first two which had been considered suitable to go to the printers. We would try to get the remaining chapters so that they could be studied and considered is soon as possible, but I simply had no way of knowing what vas their present status and through which channels they would be handled. We would let them know as soon as we knew anything.
