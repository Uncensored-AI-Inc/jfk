Otra de las facetas de la investigación y seguridad, es el espionaje y contraespionaje de empresas y compañías, o bien para instalar sistemas internos o para llevarle los secretos a la competencia.

escapar! más probable es que le vaya peor que antes.

No provoque a los secuestradores pues es un riesgo innecesario que se corre con personas desconocidas. ¡Y no los subestime! Recuerde que pueden ser tan inteligentes

podemos garantizar nada

No tome a broma lo que aqui acabamos de decirle. Un secuestro está a la vuelta de la esquina en cualquier país y en cualquier momento. Si no lo cree revise las páginas de su diario. Y buena suerte!

INDUSTRIAL Carlos Dominguez se pagó el rescate mas caro hasta el momento en nuestro pais: 5 millones de bolivares.

## SE ACABO LA VIDA PRIVADA

No es nada nuevo hoy en día que una compania pueda estar vigilada totalmente. Desde el control de sus hijos telefónicos, hasta micrófonos escondidos en las salas de conferencias, o en las oficinas de sus principales ejecutivos: tampoco es raro que un señor tome fotos allí mismo con una cámara escondida en un maletín, o que a esa empresa le graben conversaciones desde una distancia de 25 metros. Tal es el caso del espionaje industrial o contraespionaje industrial. Investigadores privados intervienen, infiltran gente dentro de una compañía, con el fin de obtener datos secretos y llevárselos a la competencia. O puede ser también que los investigadores penetren a la agencia como para. Cir que salgan datos se instala entonces un sistema de seguridad interno.

Y cuando nos referimos a estos hechos no estamos hablando de países capitalistas foráneos de gran desarrollo industrial, sino a esta tierra tropical y subdesarrollada En Venezuela muchísimas companias prestan estos servicios. Una de ellas es la que dirige el serior Luis Posada en una empresa que funciona desde el año 74 "Investigaciones Commerciales e Industriales" (ICI), se basa en la experiencia de su Director Gerente, el señor Posada, quien cuenta con 16 años dedicados a estas actividades de investigación, repartidos en la policía_de_ Norteamerica, en la DISIP y ahora en funciones privadas

Conservando el acento de su tierra de origen. Cuba. Posada converso con MOMENTO -Nosotros no tratamos investigaciones de adulterio, ni cosas por el estilo. Nuestra función no es para los abogados, que son los que se enriquecen con ello. La compañía se dedica a las empresas de seguros, comercios e industrias. El 90% se enfila a robos cometidos en las industrias, cuya culpabilidad se da casi siempre en los propios empleados de estas empresas. También se investigan homicidios e incendios

-¿Y qué hacen para casos de espionaje industrial?

-Tenemos des tipos de operaciones. Ofensiva y defensiva. En las primeras, se sabe la otra comente es para cefenderse de elio Un sospechoso deshonesto puede ser fotografiado cuando hace una entrevista con alguien de la competencia. Puede ser precisado y neutralizado un directivo que se fue de la empresa y se está llevando al personal. Podemos también hacer vigilancia a los ejecutivos desde las personas con quienes almuerza hasta que hace por la noche.

Refiere que uno de los más modernos equipos que tienen es un detector de mentiras, a base de un test, que permite con una cinta grabada de la voz, determinar si el exáminado miente o no.

-¿Ha dado resultado este detector?

-Con el aparato descubrimos un desfalco de 200 mil bolívares habide en una empresa, donde grabamos a mas de 50 empleados

Nos muestra unos grabadores mínimos, casi invisibles, que funcionan con baterías que duran ocho días, o utilizables también con corriente directa. Un pequeño equipo de telefonía, intercepta telefonos a sólo tres cuadras de la casa vigilada, sin intervención de la DISIP ni otros cuerpos policiales.

-También hacemos "barridas" esto significa que nosotros localizamos y neutralizamos micrófonos que se hayan instalado previamente. cuando en un sitio va a haber una reunión importante

secreta Es un caso de contraespionaje. Graban conversaciones desde una distancia de 35 metros. Desde un maletín podemos hacer fotografías a personas de oficinas tambien desde la cartera de mujer

Expresa que en las oficinas que tienen en Caracas y Valencia cuentan con un personal femenino de siete mujeres. También poseen un archivo, donde fichan los casos que han investigado y otros datos. Afirma Posada que no realizan investigaciones políticas.

Tal como se ve la vida privada, dejo de serlo

HE TOLD US THAT RECENTLY, WHILE IN VENENZUELA, HE MET WITH LUIS (POSADA) CARRILES, A VENEZUELAN CITIZEN OF CUBAN ORIGIN. HE TOLD US THAT POSADA, ALLEGEDLY A FORMER AGENCY ASSET, HAD REQUESTED ASSISTANCE IN OFFERING FOR A PRICE POSADA'S SERVICES TO BKHERALD. DIEGUEZ SAID THAI POSADA HAS CLOSE CONTACT WITH HIGH RANKING VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND COULD PROVIDE BKHERALD WITH VALUABLE IN- FORMATION.

2.  DIEGUEZ SHOWED US A COPY OF A LENGTHY DOCUMENT GIVEN TO HIM BY POSADA SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR PERUSAL AS EVIDENCE OF THE TYPE OF INFORMATION TO WHICH HE HAS ACCESS. THIS DOCUMENT CONSISTED OF A LIST OF CUBAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN CARACAS, BIOGRAPHICAL DATA AND ADDRESSES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS, AND VARIOUS SUNDRY INFORMATION ON JAMAICA, GUYANA, PANAMA, AND ANGOLA. WE DID NOT ACCEPT THE DOCUMENT FOR TRANSMITTAL TO HEADQUARTERS BECAUSE IN OUR JUDGEMENT, TO HAVE DONE SO MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED AN AGREEMENT ON OUR PART TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL REMUNERATION AT SOME FUTURE DATE.

3.  DIEGUEZ ALSO SAID THAT DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF FORMER PRESIDENT RAFAEL (CALDERA), POSADA WAS A FAIRLY HIGH RANKING OFFICER IN THE DIRECTORATE OF SERVICES OF INTELLIGENCE AND PREVENTION (DISIP). HE WAS DISMISSED FROM THIS POSITION WHEN CARLOS ANDRES (PEREZ) BECAME PRESIDENT. DIEGUEZ SAID THAT AS A DISIP OFFICIAL POSADA WAS INSTRU- MENTAL IN THE ELIMINATION OF GUERRILLA OPERATIONS AND STRONGHOLDS. AT THAT TIME, POSADA WAS KNOWN AS "COMISARIO BASILIO".

4.  DIEGUEZ SAID THAT POSADA, CURRENTLY A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, IN VENEZUELA, LIVES AT CALLE VALENCIA, QUINTA MARIANINA, LAS PALMAS CARACAS. HIS OFFICE TELEPHONE NUMBERS ARE 743232 AND 742857, DIEG EZ ALSO SAID THAT IF BKHERALD IS INTERESTED IN OBTAINING POSADA'S SERVICE CONTACT SHOULD BE INITIATED THROUGH HIM (DIEGUEZ) AND NOT DIRECTLY TO POSADA FOR SECURITY REASONS. HOWEVER, IF NECESSARY POSADA CAN TRAVEL TO THE US.

5.  DIEGUEZ WAS TOLD THAT HIS REQUEST IN BEHALF OF POSADA WOULD BE FORWARDED THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE CHANNELS AND THAT WE COULD NOT PROMISE ANY POSITIVE RESULTS. - END

1. SUGGEST YOU COUNSEL UKSCARLET-3 THAT IF NEITHER HE NOR HIS
   WIFE HAVE ENTERED THE U.S. WITHIN THE PERIOD WHEN THEIR ALIEN
   RE-ENTRY PERMITS WERE VALID, AND IF THEY DESIRE TO RETAIN THEIR STATUS
   AS PERMANENT-RESIDENT ALIENS (PRA), THEY MUST MAKE APPLICATIONS FOR
   RETURNING RESIDENT VISAS WITH THE CARACAS CONSULATE. THERE IS NO
   GUARANTEE THAT THE VISAS WILL BE ISSUED, SINCE ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO
   QUOTA NUMBER INVOLVED, THE PROCESSING IS THE SAME AS ANY OTHER
   IMMIGRANT VISA, WITH THE CONSULAR OFFICER HAVING THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO
   MAKE THE DETERMINATION AS TO ELIGIBILITY. IF THEY APPLY SOLELY FOR A
   TOURIST VISA IN THEIR VENEZUELAN PASSPORT, THEY COULD LOSE THEIR PRA
   STATUS, SINCE APPLYING FOR A TOURIST VISA IS PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE
   OF ABANDONMENT OF PRA STATUS. IF THEY OBTAIN RETURNING
   RESIDENT VISAS, THEY SHOULD BE ADVISED TO OBTAIN NEW RE-ENTRY PERMITS
   WHILE IN U.S. Y

1. Based on a reconciliation of WKSCARLET/3's 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1974 Federal income tax returns, it has been determined that he has an excessive tolerance (underpayment of tax) in the amount of $512.00 for 1971, $549.00 for 1972, $769.00 for 1973 and $425.00 for 1974. Attached, under separate cover, is a sealed envelope containing copies of each reconciliation which have not been classified so that they may be handcarried to him for review. If security permits, this envelope should be opened only by WKSCARLET/3. The Station is requested to treat these documents as classified and they should be destroyed or retained in a sealed envelope by the Station.

2. The $1,860.47 due WKSCARLET/3 per Paragraph 2 of Reference C should have been reduced by $349.25 (per Paragraph 1 of Reference A) representing underpayment of 1969 and 1970 taxes. Attached is Headquarters T/A # CC-0140 in the amount of $1,511.22, representing the 1971 tax due of $512.00, 1972 tax due of $549.00 and a portion of the 1973 tax due of $450.22. The collection of these taxes will liquidate the final payment due WKSCARLET/3. The balance of tax due must be paid by WKSCARLET/3.

3. Please advise WKSCARLET/3 to mail his personal check in the amount of $743.78 to the accommodation address forwarded by Reference D. This amount represents the remaining portion of the 1973 taxes due of $318.78 that were not liquidated by his final payment and the 1974 taxes due of $425.00. The check should be made payable to himself without endorsement on the reverse. Also, please advise WKSCARLET/3 that the cashier's check for $147.00 and his original 1971 through 1974 tax returns were mailed to the IRS Philadelphia Office on 30 June 1975.

B. Caracas 25040 (17 July 1974)

1.  Based on a reconciliation of MEXCARLET/J's 1969 and 1970 Federal income tax returns, it has been determined that he has an excessive tolerance (underpayment of tax) in the amount of $151.25 for 1969 and $198.00 for 1970. Attached is Headquarters T/A FCC-0057 for the total amount of $349.25 that should be collected from the final payment due MEXCARLET/3 per Paragraph 3 of Reference B. Attached in a sealed envelope are copies of each reconciliation which have not been classified so that they may be hand-carried to him for review. If security permits, this envelope should be opened only by MEXCARLET/3. The Station is requested to treat these documents as classified and they should be destroyed or retained in a sealed envelope by the Station.

2.  Please advise Headquarters when we may expect to receive copies of MEXCARLET/3's Federal tax returns for tax years 1971 through 1974. (A copy of his 1961 tax return is not required, since his MAXIMUM income for tax year was under $3,600, which qualifies him to be administered under the provisions of IR 23-101). To ensure confidential and timely handling of an individual's tax returns and related correspondence, all administrative (T) dispatch should be directed to Chief, JLCUT, for all JLCUT tax material. Please see Hook Dispatch 9711 dated 3 October 1974 for detailed instructions.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Alien Affairs Officer,
OPS/LSN

SUBJECT : Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles

1. On 30 June 1974 Luis Clemente POSADA's employment with the Agency was terminated by mutual consent. At that time ho was establishing a private investigative agency from which he expected to earn his livelihood. The Immigration and Naturalization Service file on POSADA, therefore, may now be decontrolled. As of 27 January 1975, POSADA is still located in Caracas, Venezuela.

2. On 12 June 1974 Caracas Station advised that POSADA had been informed of and fully understands the effect that termination of his Agency employment will have upon his resident alien status and eligibility for U.S. citizenship. We have not yet received termination records on POSADA, probably because the Station is still meeting with him regarding settlement of his outstanding U.S. tax liabilities.

SOURCE INFORMATION   FVALUATION

(4) WKSCARLET-3. WKSCARLET-3 was granted a POA effective 17 January 1972 and an OA effective 17 July 1972. He was first brought to the attention of the Station by WH/Miami. It is difficult to tell from our files exactly when contact was initiated, but as early as 1965, Subject was being used by EKHERALD. WKSCARLET-3 is currently in the process of establishing a private investigative company in Caracas. From January through March 1974, when the new government took over and WKSCARLET-3 was asked to leave his job, he was the Chief of *our of SeeURITY* of WKSCARLET, and reported on all aspects, operations, etc. of that unit. He is now in the process of being terminated, effective 30 June 1974, by his case officer, BACHHUBER, due to his lack of access and high profile. WKSCARLET-3 currently receives compensation in the amount of Bs2,000 per month. Subject was last successfully given an SGSWIRL on 8 May 1973. Since March 1974, his profile has been relatively high. There have been two articles in the local press naming him as a BKHERALD agent. Since those two articles, none have appeared; however, he has several high powered personal enemies in the current government and could come under political attack at any time. The Station does not feel that NKSCARLET-3 presents or will present a security threat. He has been well treated during his long relationship with BKHERALD which he realizes and is thankful for. Meetings to carry out the termination are being conducted with strict regard for security. A safehouse used for part of the period (S/IH 45) and costing about $950, was terminated in March 1974. The only special commitment with WKSCARLET-3 is a termination payment of Bs6,000.

7. WKSCARLET-3 -- WKSCARLET-3 is being met on a weekly basis in a safehouse. While his access remains unchanged, his reporting has dropped off during this reporting period due mostly to the fact that his energies are being directed against guerrillas and since the capture of Gabriel Puertas and Carlos Betancourt, the WKSCARLETS have had little success in this field. WKSCARLET-3's division is currently working against Gordo Mansania, Solo Suarez, Tito Herrera, and Elias Eljury. During the period he produced no disseminations, however, information reported by him was used for one field comment.

3. From a negative point of view, WKNUGGET coverage of the home phone of WKSCARLET-3 was useful in that it did not reveal any indications that he was involved in narcotics trafficking. Since he also successfully passed his SGSWIRL, and satisfied the Station in a debriefing that he was not trafficking in narcotics, the WKNUGGET coverage of WKSCARLET-3 was discontinued.

14. As Headquarters is already aware, WKSCARLET-3 passed his SGSWIRL with flying colors on 8 May. Based on the SGSWIRL and his earlier debriefing concerning his alleged involvement in narcotics, it seems that WKSCARLET-3 was only guilty of having the wrong kind of friends. LRAGON Caracas was advised on 15 May regarding our conclusions based upon the debriefing and SOSWIRL of WKSCARLET-3. LNAGO Caracas agreed with our conclusions and now regards the case as being closed. WKSCARLET-3 agreed, and we so advised LAGO!!, that WKSCARLET-3 would help out with narcotics leads he might come across. We told LNASON that such assistance would only be on an ad hoc basis subject to our other priorities as well as WKSCARLET-3's security.

TO : WH/3/V

FROM : Interrogation Research Division

SUBJECT: WKSCARLET/3 - IDENTITY A
201-300985

IRD# 72501

BACKGROUND:

Subject of this report is a KMSTONE born citizen of IDEN B who has permanent resident alien status in WODUAL. Subject was granted a renewed DA on 17 July 1972 and he was last SGSWIRLed on 3 November 1971 with favorable results. Subject estimated that he has been SGSWIRLed approximately ten times by BKHERALD and two or three additional times by the WODUAL Army.

PURPOSE AND PROCEDURE:

On 8 May 1973, in IDEN C, Subject was again SGSWIRLed at the request of his Case Officer, Gabriel J. LABRENZ. The session was conducted in order to determine if Subject has ever been involved in the illegal drug traffic as alleged by a LNAGON source and also whether Subject knows anyone involved in the illegal drug business. Subject has a good command of the English language and the entire session was conducted in English. All of the test questions were coordinated with LABRENZ in advance and he remained in an adjoining room within hearing range. This examiner was introduced to Subject as Bill JOHNSON from WODUAL.

RESULTS:

No indications of daception.

SGSWIRL results supported Subject in his contentions as follows:

1.  that, excluding what he told us (See DETAILS), he has not used drugs for non-medicinal reasons.

2.  that, excluding IDEN D, he is not acquainted with anyone who he knows is involved in the illegal drug traffic. (See DETAILS for those he "suspects.")

3. that, excluding what he told us (See DETAILS), he has never received money or been involved in the sale, purchase, or smuggling of drugs.

4. that, excluding what he told us (See DETAILS), he has never been asked to participate in the illegal drug traffic.

DETAILS:

During the pre-test discussion, Subject stated that he personally has smoked marijuana on three or four occasions and he has sniffed cocaine on approximately five occasions in the past ten years. Subject asserted that on each occasion, he was attending social gatherings with KMSTONE friends and he felt socially compelled to indulge in order to please the other participants. He estimated that he knows approximately thirty-five people who use cocaine or marijuana. Subject asserted that his last use of cocaine was last month when he visited MODUAL. SGSWIRL supported Subject's claim that his personal use of drugs has not been more extensive.

During the pre-test discussion, Subject asserted that he was not acquainted with anyone who he knew for certain was involved in drug trafficking. Subject did list the following IDENS when asked if he knew anyone who he "suspected" was involved in trafficking drugs: IDENS D, E, F, G, H and I. Subject asserted that his suspicions were based on rumor and these people have never talked to him about illegal drugs. After recording reactions to the test question, "Are you concealing the identity of anyone who you know is involved in the sale or smuggling of drugs?" (Ans. No), Subject acknowledged that his concern for the question was due to the fact that he more than merely "suspected" IDEN D was involved and he was "90% certain."

During the pre-test discussion, Subject stated that in 1954 or 1955 while in KMSTONE, he and a friend sold a non-dangerous drug to a buyer who believed it to be cocaine. Subject asserted that he made $25.00 from this transaction. Also, while in KMSTONE at the same

time, Subject stated that a friend, IDEN J. asked him if he wished to participate in the smuggling of cocaine out of Peru. Subject advised that he declined the offer. As previously noted. SGSHIRL results supported Subject's contentions that his involvement with dangerous drugs has not been more extensive.

HISTORY OF VUTINI MACHINE ISSUE RRCOUNTD

Caracas Radio Continente Network in Spanish 0300 GMT 11 Apr 73 P

[Text] The president of the Supreme Electoral Council, Luis A. Pietri, has denied the charges made regarding the collection of nommissions on the sale of voting machines. Just as this station has reported, Piotri has ordered a thorough investigation in order to establish responsibilities. The armoungemant was made by Pietri during a press non-feronce hold tonight at the headquarters of the Supreme Council. Speaking for himself. Piotri #aid that he would have filed suit against those implicated in the commissions deal. Ho said that he would have started the suit if he had known which persons were involved in the affair.

The statement made by Antonio Espinoza Prieto regarding a supposed reduction in the contract for the purchase of the voting machines is completely false, said the comptroller goneral, Mamuel Viconte Ledesma. The report was published in local newspapers. Accord-frig to the papers Antonio Bspinosa Prieto said that Mr Dixon, former president of the Automatic Voting Machines (AVN) Comparty, had come to Venezuela to negotiate a reduction in the price of the contract. (Words indistinct) Prieto said that the reduction was in the nature of $3,050,000, but the comptroller general of the republic denied the infor-mation bocause his office never had any knowledge of Prieto's assertion.

The affairs of the collection of commissions on the purchase of voting machines has turned into a real scandal. It will be recalled that the proposal to purchase the voting machines in the first place was a sensation. On that occasion the representatives of the various parties represented in the Suprema Bloctoral Council were divided. The Opposition insisted that machines had to be used in the next elections because the lava specified this. The Social Christian Party (COPBI), the Democratic National Front (PHD) and an independent party were opposed to the purchase because it meant a disbursement of millions of bolivares. Subsequently the matter was submitted to a vote and the opposition parties won.

Contacts were begin with the machine supplier and more disagreements arose. The oppo-sition wanted to purchase the machines from AVM, while COPEI and AND wanted to purchase them from another company. The opposition won again because it was in the majority and it was decided that AVM would supply the molinos. Tuo U.3. representatives arrived: the owners, the salesmu, and the comalsalon agents of the company. The contract was drafted and it specified that Venerula mould not pay more than 1 peruent of the total transaction in commissions. The transaction was for 180 million bolivares.

At this stage a ghost appeared to pursue the AVM in the United States in the form of the Klection Systoms Company, which sued the AVM, alleging that the AVM negotiated directly in Venezuela without going through the Elections Systems Company. The latter demnanted its commission and last week won the suit. This is how the scandal broke: The AVM said that it could not pay commissiors to the Election Systems Company because these commissions had been paid directly to Venezuolan politicians. The AVM defended itself and its representatives said at the trial what they had to say, which is precise-ly what Pedro Segnini La Cruz told this papers today. The People's Electoral Movement [MPE) was accused of having received $40 par machine which, multiplied by 10,000, amounts to $400,000, or 1.8 million bolivares.

# MILITARY COURT QUESTIONS BLANCO PARTY LEADER

Paris AFP in Spanish 1453 GMT 11 Apr 73 C--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

[Excerpts] Montevideo, 11 Apr--Reliable sources today reported that the military court has asked Biance Party national leader Omar Murdoch for information about a declaration issued 2 weeks ago in which the Bianco Party strongly criticized President Bordaberry and the military authorities.

The military court is trying to establish whether the Blanco Party leader committee a violation of military regulations. It also asked Murdoch whether he concurred with the terms of the Blauco Party declaration.

It was reported that the alleged violation concerned the military regulation which prevents retired officers from participating in or formulating political declarations during the 4 years following their retirement.

According to reliable sources, Murdoch--a retired navy captain--will be brought before the military tribunal if the violation is confirmed.

The military court's action agitated the political atmosphere and the Blanco Party leaders will meet this evening to discuss the situation. A Blanco Party member expressed the opinion that instead of looking into the political attitudes of retired officers, the military court should try those military men on active duty who have in effect formed a political party.

It was revealed in parliamentary circles that opposition legislators will demand in parliament that the defense minister explain the true motives which led to the proceedings initiated by the military court.

# ARGENTINE AUTHOR RELEASED PROM URUGUAYAN PRISON

Paris APP in Spanish 1445 GMT 11 Apr 73 C--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

[Text] Montevideo, 11 Apr--Argentine writer and journalist Eduardo Galeano was released yesterday by a military court after a 1-week detention. Galeano himself confirmed his release today and said that he was in perfect health and that he had been well-treated during his detention.

He was arrested at Carrasco Airport on his return from a visit to several Latin American countries. Galeano, who has been living in Uruguay for a long time, is a journalist of the leftist weekly MARCHA and was recently appointed director of the Argentine review CRISIS.

In addition, the representative the MSP, Antonio Espinoza Prieto, received 450,000 bolivares. The same arrangement was made for the Democratic Republican Union [URD] and Omar Rambos, another one of the representatives of the opposition on the Supreme Electoral Council. Rambos and his party received similar amounts to those received by the MFS and Espinoza Prieto. Democratic Action [AD], which was also accused, was supposed to receive more than the others, that is, 2,115,000 bolivares. The distribution also included several lawyers, one Mr (Hans), and others named Eduardo Blanco and Leoni.

According to the same document released by Segnini La Cruz today, the AVM representative said that he unknowingly signed a commission invoice for $305 per machine. This means there is a $2 commission per machine, the recipient of which the AVM representative said he did not know. As spokesmen for public opinion, we are obliged to inform the Venezuelan people about the content of Segnini La Cruz' document. In the meantime, it is up to those involved to explain the scandal of the collection of commissions for the purchase of the voting machines.

The comptroller's office has never had any information to the effect that the former president of the AVM came to Venezuela to negotiate a reduction in price. Manuel Vicente Ledesma made the explanation in connection with a report published in the local newspapers and attributed to Antonio Espinoza Prieto. Prieto said that Mr Dixon had come to Venezuela to reduce the selling price of the voting machines by $3,050,000. From another quarter, Ledesma said that the tools and supplies which will be used to manufacture the machines will remain in Venezuela. In addition, the country will take possession of the voting machines in a domestic port and not abroad.

## QUERRILLA LEADER CABANAS CLAINS KIDNAPING ROLE

Paris AFP in Spanish 0445 GMT 11 Apr 73 C--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

[Text] Acapulco, 10 Apr--Lucio Cabanas, top guerrilla leader of the country, appears as sigratory of a press communique in which he claims responsibility for kidnaping a rich cattle breeder, Franciso Sanches Lopez, on 7 March in Texpan, Guerrero State.

The document was published today, Tuesday, by the newspapers LA VERDAD and EL GRAPICO issued in Acapulco with a picture of live masked men in uniforms and with Mexican Army guns surrounding someone who seems to be Sanchez Lopez.

Lucio Cabanas added to his alleged signature the title of head of the executing peasant brigade of the Poor People's Party, in the name of which he accused Mexican society of being capitalist and of exploiting the people and said, that for this reason, this society must be eliminated.

He added that the kidnaped cattle breeder, of whom nobody has heard since his disappearance, is a bourgois who exploits the people whose land he has seized by means of usury and unlawful maneuvers.

He called the government a bloody murderer of peasants and stated that, for this reason, the executing brigade applies the law of retaliation in kind and justly retaliates by means of executions and kidnapings as well as bank and company holdups. After urging peasants and students to join the movement, Lucio Cabanas said, in conclusion: Our basic method is that of arms.

OPLMIABYSS/Forwarding of BNDD Document's Regarding Luis POSADA

Reference: CARACAS-21539

1. Forwarded herewith are two BNDD ROIS and one telegram regarding Luis POSADA. The first ROI prepared by S/A Jose Marin and dated 6 February 1973 is based on a debriefing of a BNDD source who identifies POSADA aka "Bambi" as being a source of supply for narcotics in Venezuela. The Cl also claims that POSADA, along with Jose Gomez and Humberto TRUEVA, have been involved in other illegal activity such as dealing in stolen merchandise, counterfeit money, and contraband.

2. The other ROI, prepared by S/A Charles R. Schaming and dated 13 March 1973, concerns a debriefing of a source who does not believe that POSADA is involved in narcotics.

3. The third document is BNDD Headquarters telegram 1846 of 23 March 1973 (repeated from Miami BXDD) concerning the debriefing of Jose GOMEZ, the BNDD CI who went sour. GOMEZ debriefing adds little and in the opinion of the Station and BNDD Caracas, GOMEZ is either lying and/or not telling the whole truth. GOMIZ lists a number of names of persons he claims to have met while in Caracas which we do not consider worth a follow up except that of Colonel Freddie BALBOA. BALBOA may possibly be the unidentified police/security official so frequently seen with GOMEZ et al.
