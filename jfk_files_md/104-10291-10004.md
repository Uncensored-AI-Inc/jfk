MEMORANDUM FOR: James S. Woods

FROM: John N. McMahon
Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Commendation for Exceptional Performance

1. The Directorate of Operations Records Review Task Force has finished its work in Warrenton. I want you to know that I realize that a large measure of the success of this effort was due to the exceptional per- formance of the Records Management Officers who worked long and hard during the six-month period, patiently guiding the 435 Directorate personnel who served on the component teams. Many of you performed additional duties, voluntarily and cheerfully, extending beyond the ten-hour work day, which kept the task force functioning smoothly.

2. This fine team effort and your personal contribution to it is in the best tradition of the Directorate of Operations. I commend you for a job well done.

MEMORANDUM FOR: FE Career Management Committee

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion of Mr. James S. Woods from GS-09 to GS-10

1. It is strongly recommended that Mr. James S. Woods be promoted from GS-09 to GS-10. Mr. Woods entered on duty with the Agency in April 1952 as a GS-03 Records and File Clerk assigned to RFD. Since that time Mr. Woods has served as a Receiver Analyst, assigned overseas in Naha and Atsugi, Manila, and since 1961 in the Central Registry Section of the Tokyo Station. Mr. Woods is 37 years old and has been a grade as a GS-09 since 1958. He was previously recommended for promotion to GS-10 in November 1965 and June 1965.

2. In the promotion recommendation for the Tokyo Station, 9 November 1964, the rater commented on Mr. Woods as follows:

"A. Mr. Woods is now on his second tour as Chief of the Tokyo Registry. This unit is located at Hanza Air Station and handles all correspondence for all station elements. In view of the fact that the station is composed of different geographic locations, a great deal of emphasis must be given to Mr. Woods to ensure that action is responsive, information is rapidly and properly secured, dispatched and processed, correspondence from the local military agencies is correctly analyzed and routed, the day-to-day orientation and the Chief Teletypewriter is rapidly carrying out proper dispatch duties."

"B. The Registry is presently composed of six employees in addition to Mr. Woods as a Chief of the Section. Mr. Woods does an exemplary job in supervising these employees with the result that the Registry is able to render the well-functioning unit."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 32

"C. In addition to his resourcefulness, Mr. Woods is constantly thinking of ways to increase the efficiency of the Station as a whole. Several of his ideas have been adopted by the Station with a resulting increase in effectiveness. His positive approach to all problems and his cheerfulness and willingness to perform any task have benefited both the Station and the Agency."

"D. In view of Mr. Woods' demonstrated ability to provide leadership to the Station Reg’y Rep'y Rep'y Rep'y Rep'y Reppy's unit, his positive approach to the solution of the many problems which ideally beset this unit, it is strongly recommended that he be promoted from GS-09 to GS-10 at the earliest opportunity."

3. Mr. Woods has continued to perform in an "above-all" manner as demonstrated in his recent "spot-check" report. He recently planned and effectively implemented the move of the Stab Secretariat from one location to another. In a dispatch, dated 22 November 1965, the present Chief of Station, Tokyo, explained

3 November 1964, for promotion

## POSITION DESCRIPTION - James S. WOODS

1.  Nature and Purpose of Work:

My position is that of intelligence analyst in the Personality File section of the Records Integration Branch. I am responsible for the maintenance of agent records and personality files.

2. Duties:

a. To maintain all agent records. This takes a good percentage of my time as it includes the following:

(1) Make all KOMI file checks on PRQ's and file check requests, writing up the results and forwarding them to the proper agencies.

(2) Make sure that all PRQ's and file check requests have the correct classification, the proper number of copies for distribution, correct name and telecodes, and are forwarded to the proper case officer or foreign unit.

(3) See that the results of KOMI file checks received from Headquarters and CHIMI are properly carded and forwarded to the case officer concerned.

(4) Keep all agent records up-to-date with regard to cryptonyms, POC's, OC's and other additional information received.

(5) Keep files on all terminated agents and see that the proper records are filled out and forwarded when they are terminated.

b. To maintain the RI card index, assuring that all cards received in RI are properly filed and have the correct names and telecodes.

c. To analyze, card and file all documents forwarded to Personality Files; these include State Station memos, MOR's, Contact Reports, CCANE Reports, ER's, various intelligence summaries, etc.

3. Responsibility for the Work of Others:

N/A

4. Scope and Effect of Work:

I am responsible for making all KOMI file checks. I must see that they are made out thoroughly, quickly and accurately. My check may decide the outcome of hiring or refusing to hire a prospective agent or other employee for an operation or project.

5. Supervision and Guidance Received:

I receive no direct supervision or guidance in duties relating to the maintenance of agent records. I receive over-all policy guidance from the Chief of RI and some guidance from branch chiefs and case officers.

b. Originality: To adopt new ways of maintaining agent records without losing control over the flow of daily material.

c. Judgment: I must decide what action should be taken on all KOMI file checks, regarding what information is to be sent to Headquarters and CHIMI.

7. Personal Work Contacts:

I must maintain close personal contact with all case officers and branch chiefs in order that I may maintain up-to-date agent records.

8. Other:

I must maintain files of all documents routed to Personality Files. Also I must resolve problems the branch chiefs or case officers may have in regard to agent records.

Also, I have recently established a 201 agent record system for the Mission and am responsible for its continual maintenance.

Dear Sir:

I received your letter dated January 5, stating that I was to inform you of any changes in my present status.

I am now a grade GS 2 with an one year increase. I am now being considered for a grade GS 3 in the Treasury Dept. I assure you, this does not lesson my zeal to get in the C.I.A.

I would like to know if your Agency would transfer or consider me for appointment at a grade GS 3.

Sincerely yours,

James Scharla

Mr. Woods continued to perform in outstanding fashion as Chief of the CCS Registry during an extremely busy period. The figures cited in the last Fitness Report as to the workload of the CCS Registry continued to be representative of the volume and variety of Mr. Woods' responsibilities. He supervised the work of six subordinates with a successful combination of patience and firm professionalisa. He continued to be the source of sound, constructive suggestions for coping with the paper "explosion" occasioned by the investigations of CIA and the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. Mr. Woods is a highly valuable, reliable, unobtrusively effective records manager. In moving on to new responsibilities in an area division he leaves behind a solid record of achievement and the admiration of those with whom he has served in CCS.

Mr. Woods is a quiet, highly effective manager of a major repository of records within the DDO. The workload of his Section in staggering: over 8,000 documents filed each month, over 500 index cards prepared each month; close to 300 Freedom of Information or Privacy Act requests processed each month, etc. Mr. Woods organizes his Section well; he handles a group of six women with skill and understanding and he heads, as a result, a harmoniously working team.

Mr. Woods approaches problems with a positive attitude and brings his considerable experience and imagination to bear with appropriate initiative and follow-through. His response to the exceptionally heavy workload of the Staff over the past year of Congressional investigations and cover exposes vas vital to the Staff's and the DDO's requirements for current and historical records. He volunteers ideas designed to improve the Staff's records; he works weekends and after hours to keep ahead of a growing avalanche of paper and requests for information. He is, in sum, a highly competent, knowledgable, yet flexible records manager upon whom the Staff relies heavily.

I have no difficulty in agreeing with the letter ratings and the narrative evaluation in the above report. Mr. Woods established the high level of his professional competence very soon after his assignment in CCS and has maintained this standard without interruption. I again must emphasize his abilities as supervisor in one of the toughest supervisory assignments known to me. With a Registry Chief like Mr. Woods, it is easy to come to the conclusion that running a registry of the complexity and volume as that of CCS is a cinch - at least he makes it appear that way

JUL 8 11 29 AM '75

During the 6 months under review Mr. Woods has continued to fulfill his responsibilities in the same excellent manner which has been documented in his last two fitness reports and which led to his promotion to GS-12. Mr. Woods surefootedness as a records officer and manager of people, together with ability to take necessary initiatives where actions are required and his maturity and sound judgement, make him an ideal chief of this very active and complex registry and records management office. I dread to think that eventual rotation will deprive me of the services of this extraordinarily competent and effective officer.

Since his last Fitness Report, in June 1974, Mr. Woods has continued his extremely fine performance as a conscientious, hard working and thoughtful records manager and registry supervisor. The CCS registry workload remains at about the same level as préviously reported, and Mr. Woods regularly works an hour or so of uninterrupted over- time every working day personally reorganizing procedures, cleaning out, consolidating. and retiring files. His enthusiastic determination in reducing the numbers of out-of- date and no longer useful files is most exemplary. Knowing the numbers of primary and supplemental files involved in this exercise, and as a retiring supervisor, I can only wish him "good luck"!

Mr. Woods also continues eager to learn and use new methods and techniques. During this reporting period, in July 1974, he took the Agency course "Introduction to Micrographics Seminar #2."

Finally it gives me pleasure to note here that, effective 24 November 1974, Mr. Hoods will be given a well deserved promotion from GS 11/6 to GS 12/3...

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Both Mr. Yates' letter ratings. and narrative comments accurately reflect the quality of Mr. Woods' performance during the reporting period. He is a thoroughgoing professional records officer who uses his extensive experience and his good judgement to take initiatives toward improving the Registry service and the management of records. Hand in hand with his high substantive competence goes his excellent ability as a super- visor. I can say nothing more laudable in this regard than that I have not had to deal with Registry personnel problems during the last year. He knows the job that needs to be done and so do his people. With this kind of leadership, the work gets accomplished with a high state of morale.

After a short overlap with his predecessor, Mr. Woods assumed his responsibilities as Chief of Registry, CCS, on 3 October 1973 roughly nine months ago. In this position he is responsible, overall, for CCS registry and records management activities, including the supervision of seven other individuals. As could be expected from even a casual reading of his past fitness reports, Mr. Woods quickly took hold, and has been performing his new responsibilities in an exemplary manner. Despite the volume and variety of files with which he was required to become familiar, early on he systematically began cleaning out, consolidating, and retiring files as appropriate, reorganizing and updating the indexing system for individual and project files, and redistributing employee workloads. He also reorganized the placement of file machinery, desks, and service counter to achieve greater employee comfort and efficiency in the utilization of personnel. Although his task as Staff Security Officer is a secondary function, he also reorganized, simplified and re-wrote the security check and duty officer roster procedures.

Indicative of the work which he supervises are selected Registry statistics for May 1974: 7015 documents filed, 8200 files pulled (and re-filed) for Staff officers' use, 6642 cables processed and distributed, 9900 facility and name searches, 2353 documents logged, 833 index cards made and filed, and 200 new files opened. During his nine months with CCS, Mr. Woods not only has had to learn the CCS "syston" himself.

Mr. Woods has proved to be a conscientious, hard-working and thoughtful records manager and supervisor, and CCS is glad to have him aboard. I am sure that the next records inventory will provide statistical evidence of his abilities as a "housecleaner."

If extra space is needed to complete Section C, otroch a separate sheet of paper. This officer has continued to perform with a high degree of effectiveness and accomplishment. He has concentrated on improving our records holding standards and on purging irrelevant and out dated files. In May 1972 he began a monthly series of progress reports for the Chief of Station outlining the month's accomplishments. Copies of these reports through January 1973 were sent to lHqs in OIRT-18014 and 18015, dated 9 Feb 73. These reports clearly show this officer's focus on records management activities, his ingenuity and agressiveness in launching programs of review of files and his tireless efforts in reduc- ing Station holdings to a practical and useable minimum. His records inventory as of September 1972, feporting a total reduction in excess of 85 feet, speaks for itself. His next report also promises to show- dramatic reductions.

This officer shows a sense of professional responsibility and deter- mination in the oft neglected function of records management, deeper and more intense than any other witnessed by the rating officer in his career He performs his other duties as Chief, Registry with an equally high degree of effectiveness. Subject officer may have been inadvertently hiding his talents under the proverbial bushel basket by having remained in the field for so long. It is the rator's hope that Ilqs now has focussed on him and has discovered his potential for greater responsibili ties. The records in this Station are tremendously improved for his having had a tour in Rome. We are certainly glad he came.

*BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL*

This officer has been remarkably effective during his tour in Rome. While we are very sorry to lose him, there is no question that his formidable talents should be used on a much broader range of records management and related problems than could be done in this Station. His next assignment in Headquarters appears to give him that additional scope. We are glad that he served in Rome and that during this tour here he received a well-deserved promotion. Rome Station's records have improved considerably as a result of this officer's tour here. I am in full agreement with the above comments and ratings.

This officer's performance over the past year has been outstanding. He is a skilled professional records manager, an indefatigable worker and a highly imaginative and efficient supervisor. Since his kast Fitness Report he has directed a TDY team of records officers in a concentrated program of records reduction. He devised the program and supervised its execution with most effective results. This officer is a driver and a doer. He constantly strives to improve the Station's records management posture and follows up with procedures designed to maintain the gains achieved by his efforts. It is highly gratifying and stimulating to work with him. He sees the broad dimensions of the task at hand and focuses constantly on improving the system. This quality convinces the rater that he is capable of greater responsibilities in a position of broader scope. I recommend that Headquarters begin to plan for the utilization of this officer on the completion of his tour of duty in Rome. He should be placed in a Headquarters position in which his skills and broad experience can be fully used and in which he can achieve the professional growth of which he is both capable and deserving.

I concur in the comments of the rating officer and believe the overall outstanding rating is well deserved.

Without losing sight of the unending pressure to reduce and periodically reorder the Station's holdings, this officer avoids assuming attitudes that are cast in cement. He works with the Branches and individual officers in solving problems rationally. He is unfailingly pleasant and courteous and is well-liked by all. The Station is fortunate to have

I have worked with this Officer just 2½ months, but this has been long enough to satisfy me that he is above average in registry work. He is a very knowledgeable registry technician, but most important, he is aggressive and imaginative in devising new procedures, or revising old ones to improve the quality of registry service to this Station. He is affable in dealing with his peers and confident and persuasive in dealing with the senior management of this Station. Shortly after his arrival he took over the analysing and distribution of the cables, and prepared a Station procedure for this purpose. Immediately following that, he devised a new procedure for handling correspondence and installed it. He had reviewed the multitudinous files at this Station and has plans to trim them back to more reasonable and appropriate dimensions. In every respect, this officer has taken charge of the function he is here to perform, and has devoted a great deal of time, thought and effort to improve it. We are indeed satisfied with his performance.

He then reviewed, downgraded, and retired approximately 350 Top Secret documents with appropriate Project and Subject files and copies destroyed. At the completion of this there was not one Top Secret document on the Branch. He devised, gained approval from FI/D, and carried out a new procedure for the downgrading of TYLOTË material from Top Secret to Secret so that it could be retired. He retired approximately 60 Project, 25 Subject, and fifty 201 files. He surveyed the Communist Party of Italy files and discovered that there were a total of 93 of which 19 were already closed. He closed 47 of the remainder and left 25 open and arranged for RID/ARD to retire all the material in the open files prior to 1 January 1971. He closed and retired Pian files dating back to the early 1950's. All in all, out of 76 feet of safe space filled with CS material, he retired 36 feet of files leaving a catalogue of where everything is or has been sent. A remarkable record (and done with a minimum of fuss and Branch dislocation)!

What he did in such a short time speaks eloquently of how he went about his duties for which see the accompanying memorandum of recommendation for promotion. Reporting officer has known him over fourteen years and has the unvarying impression of him as a quietly competent, diligent, reliable, self-reliant individual. /continued/

3. 
COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL I concur in the above evaluation. Subject turned in a most impressive performance during his brief time on the Italian Branch. Largely as a result of his enthusiasm and initiative, the Branch was able to achieve what had never been accomplished before; a complete overhaul, cleaning, purging, and restructuring of its filing system. To his credit, Subject has a keen appreciation for operational requirements and all of this work was done without sacrificing the future utilization of information acquired in the past; on the contrary, the efficient use of this material has been so enhanced that it will surely be reflected in our future operations. Mr. Woods has a unique contribution to make in Rome or any other place he is assigned, The Station is fortunate to have him....his presence is sorely needed to do the same thing in Rome that he has just accomplished

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action.

In the four months he has been under my supervision, Subject has demonstrated that he merits in full measure the high opinion of him held by his previous supervisor. Conscientious, careful, fully knowledgeable of Registry procedures he has gone about his day-to-day tasks in an exceptionally proficient way without the need for constant supervision. He is prompt in his response to requests and has an excellent sense of "get the job done". He is an intelligent and concerned supervisor who has been meticulous in keeping his supervisors briefed on personnel and other problems as they have arisen in the Station Registry. He appears fully capable of assuming larger responsibilities in the records field. The rating officer regrets that Subject's family situation precludes his staying for another tour.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action.

If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

With about nineteen months experience managing the station registry already under his belt, his usefulness here increases. Ho continues to demonstrate the same quietly effective leadership and talent for sound organization in his own shop as were noted on the last fitness report.

While maintaining a high standard in the more routine day- to-day services and processes a registry is normally expected to supply, he has also been the catalyst for a thorough, carefully phased and continuing review and, where appropriate, purge of registry and other file holdings. Administering this ambitious reduction program requires sound judgment and experience in handling the detail in our existing records. Subject has these qualities and has achieved impressive results. To complete this task, he has asked to extend his tour here for one year until November 1971 and Headquarters has approved this.

He is invariably completely responsive to guidance from the DCOS, his immediate supervisor, and conscientiously seeks to achieve the work goals which are identified during our occasional accomplishment and performance consultations. The spirit of cooperation with which he deals with other station personnel is equally commendable.

No criticism can be made of his security and cover deportment.

## SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable. He arrived ten months ago at this post with considerable experience in Registry work at Headquarters and at other field stations and with a thorough understanding of how a Station Registry should be organized and run. He immediately put this understanding to good use. While maintaining the overall efficiency of Registry programs already in effect when he took over, he enthusiastically began a carefully-planned and continuing effort to further reduce less than essential Registry paper holdings with results which are already impressive. His suggestions on new procedures designed to conserve space and man-power are usually imaginative and practical.

He himself is a remarkably well-organized, conscientious and cooperative person.

He has had to undertake his improvements while accommodating to the loss of one Registry slot which fell victim to a Foreign Service reductions program. Primarily due to his managerial talents, the Registry has been made to carry on almost as well with three regulars as with the previous four. Although his people are increasingly hard-worked, their morale is high. He himself appears to be a glutton for work but his Registry is obviously a happy shop.

Subject is responsible for the supervision and operation of one of the more diversified and complex field registry operations in the Organization. He is thoroughly knowledgeable and experienced in registry practices. Subject is a dedicated and hard working officer who will apply himself diligently to individual registry activities. Such diligent application occasionally causes him to overlook his over-all supervisory role, the supervision and management of eleven personnel and the responsibility for providing a wide variety of services, locally and in-country. In the press of his activities, he does not always employ a high degree of tact in dealing with his subordinates. In this context it should be noted that he is performing proficiently in a position well above his present grade level.

During the past several months, the Section has undergone several changes and assumed additional functions under his guidance.

Subject is cost conscious in the use of supplies and equipment in his section.

Subject is attending evening courses leading toward his degree to further himself professionally.

FOSHAG has continued to perform at a "Strong" level. He is a fine supervisor and thereby gets maximum performance from staff which is too small to handle a work load which has constantly increased over the past year. He is cost conscious in funds material and also strives to stream-line and improve the functioning of the Registry and its related functions.

FOSHAG has twice been recommended for promotion. He definitely deserves it and should be assigned next to a position above his present rating.

Woods
DEC 15 9 21 AM '65

During the four months has been under my supervision he has demonstrated very real supervisory ability and a talent for getting maximum performance from a small staff which handles an increasingly large volume of work. He has also shown his ability to cut the costs of his operation.

Woods
not only runs a most efficient Registry but is also constantly seeking ways to improve and stream-line its operation. He is a man who takes such interest in his job that his ideas and plans for improvement are carefully worked out and sound.

Though I have observed his work for only four months, I believe his over-all performance is "Strong" and close to "Outstanding." He has been recommended for promotion. He deserves it.

As Chief of the Station Registry this employee continues to perform exceptionally proficient level with little supervision from his supervisor. His supervisor is being reassigned and is scheduled to be replaced by another officer who will necessarily need several months to become knowledgeable of Registry activities. Whatever there is no concern that the flow of paper and the maintenance of accurate records will be affected due to the turnover of supervisors. This employee continues to use his native ingenuity and high standards of achievement to ensure that his office continues to be a well run and efficient unit. He continues to ensure that no government funds are wasted, even to the extent of arranging for the construction of certain modifications to the Registry office by Registry employees at little cost to the Government. This employee has been performing at a level above his present GS-09 grade. As recommended in November 1964, it is reconfirmed that this employee should be promoted to the next higher grade at the earliest possible opportunity.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I concur in this rating and add that this employee has not let the very serious personal problems thrust upon him during this period interfere in any way with his consistently dependable performance. In this key role, in any station of this size, dependability, reliability, and confidence are "musts" and while there are quite naturally small aggravating incidents of mis-routing or mis-direction of documents, I have been struck by the lack of them here, because ratee has the "must" qualities. His performance certainly warrants favorable consideration of the projected promotion action.

## SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in currant position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for dutermining future personnal action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

As the Chief of the Tokyo Registry this employee has performed well. He has abundant energy and constantly comes up with ideas for the improvement of the efficiency of his unit. He welcomes hard work and is able to fill in and take over any job in his unit and keep up with his own duties as well. As a supervisor, he has a slight tendency to be arbitrary when convinced he is right. This may be due to the fact that the Registry frequently operates under conditions of pressure due to the recent reorganization, reduction, and relocation of the Station. The Station has been required to get the job done with fewer people and under more difficult working conditions.

Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide basis for determining future personnel actions.

![mailroom logo] Itace has been in charge of station registry since 24th MAILROOM. This has been a period of dramatic change in the station and especially in our paper management. He has responded well to these changes and shows a degree of adaptability that bodes well. His handling of our recent "holdings" inventory, his unceasing efforts to reduce unnecessary holdings, and his knowledge of his business (RI) have made him a valued addition to our shrinking team. In this short rating period there has been little opportunity for me to observe his supervisory abilities, but the lack of any problem on this count coming to my attention seems to me that he is doing well. Another six months should tell us more on this score.

SECTION E

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employees for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for employment and greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Subject is an excellent records officer. His interest in the subject and his perseverance in carrying out tasks connected with it have not only produced results in his own work, but have kindled enthusiasm and interest within the Division in developments in Agency records management. He has been able to improve records within the Division with a great deal of success, and at the same time avoided the usual aversion to records responsibility which too much emphasis on records creates in the case officer. His ability to get along well with others is important in his liaison function.

Mr. Woods' work on the vital materials program in the last year has resulted in a much more realistic program for the Division. The creation and up-to-date retention of vital materials has for some time been a problem for which little solution could be found. It appears that the present program will result in vital materials which will be current and usable if needed.

Subject is at present assigned to a part-time detail in MMU. This should help to broaden his knowledge of new approaches in the records field. A/EXO/DDP has expressed his complete satisfaction with the very effective work Mr. Woods is doing on this detail.

Mr. Woods' work during the last year has been the basis for a commendation of the Division's records program by CO/ satisfactory performance.

OFFICE OF PERSONNEL of unfavorable

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is 501 degree to most people. The descriptive words are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that category is divided into three small blocks; this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you 16.55 of the state- ment on the left - then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

To stimulate habits of thoughtful, self-critical writing for intelligence production.

## SECTION III: SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COURSE

The class is conducted for 10 to 15 students in morning sessions over a period of four weeks. There are three sessions during the first week and two thereafter for three weeks. The course is run on the "learn by practice" system. A number of writing tests are given in class, and they are evaluated against national and agency norms. The trainees also prepare written exercises and have an opportunity to rewrite some of them during later sessions. Students may use the form and substance of their own office's written product. Special attention is paid to logical organization, diction, sentence structure and other mechanics of writing.

SECTION V: REPORT OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT

Mr. Woods considerably improved the clarity of his writing during the course, by reducing sentence errors and roundabout phrasing. His written papers reflected his gains in knowledge of basic rules of English usage. His achievement in the Writing Workshop (Basic) shows that Mr. Woods can develop good writing skills, and that he and the Agency would benefit if he took the Writing Workshop (Intermediate).

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Clandestine Service Personnel Staff

SUBJECT: James S. WOODS - Recommendation for Promotion

1. Subject has been in grade GS-10 since June 1968. Based on his outstanding performance as Chief of Registry in the Romo Station since June 30, 1971, he strongly merits promotion to grade GS-11 at this time. When Subject took over the responsibility for Registry a year ago, he found a system glutted with paper and bound up by a policy which discouraged getting rid of it. He found many procedures in force which were out of date, if not obsoleto, and proposed streamlined procedures, which were adopted, to replace them. He asked for and was given the responsibility to analyze and distribute the cables, which had previously been a function of the Chief of Station's secretary. He recommended the discontinuance of the abstract system, which proposal had been adopted by most clements of the Station. He recommended a reduction in the retention period for cable and dispatch chronos. With the help of a TDY team here for the first half of. CY 1972, he devised and instituted a program of purging the files. This program has resulted in the disposition of most of the departed Soviet files, a severe trimming of the true name files, and the review, reduction and up-dating of the project and operational files. All of this work was cccompanied by appropriate name checks, cntries on the index cards and selection of pertinent documents for transmittal to Headquarters. In summary, Subject performed a thorough "house- cleaning" of Station records in the full meaning of that phrase. This program is by no means finished. In fact, Subject has plans for continuing efforts along these lines which may exceed his tenure at this Station since he intends to return to Headquarters not later than May 1974. The on-going program includes a review and reorganization of the subject files, the encrypted 201's and the disposition (hopefully) of about 50 feet of micro- film. A corollary to these projects will be a significant reduction in the index cards, which at present lead to the micro- film and to other superfluous material we either have or will destroy.

2. The equally important aspect of records management, namely the introduction of procedures to lessen the likelihood

if not prevent the reoccurrence of this pile-up of paper
is not lost on this officer. He constantly thinks in terms
of procedures and controls to accomplish this end.

3. Subject is dedicated, highly motivated, con-
   scientious, and hard working. He reports to work each day
   an hour before the Station opens in order to distribute the
   cables by opening of business. He never hesitates to respond
   positively to any request for help. Indeed, he solicits
   work which he believes can be done more easily or more simply
   in his unit. In all respects, Subject is a trained, profes-
   sional records management officer who is thoughtful as well
   as enthusiastic about his work.

4. It is strongly recommended that Subject be pro-
   moted to grade GS-11.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, European Division

FROM: Chief of Station, London

SUBJECT: Promotion Recommendation - James S. Woods

Subject, who has been in grade as a GS-10 just two years, has been Chief of the Registry of the London Station for eighteen months. Subject, fresh from a Saigon assignment, brought with him a broad and varied background of field experience (Far East) and several Headquarters' assignments. He has been in one or another aspect of records management work since he started with us as a very junior clerk in 1952.

Subject's fitness reports, since he has been in London, testify to the high regard in which he is held by the Station and the excellent results he has managed to achieve. When he arrived at the Station, the start had been made on a file reduction program but an enormous amount of organized work remained to be done. Subject set about it with great enthusiasm and a high degree of professional organization. As a result, the Registry inventory today is the leanest and the most efficient the Station has seen for many a long day, if ever before. To a great extent this can be laid at Subject's own door and he personally did much of the work. At the same time, Subject surveyed and reorganized the over- all workload of the Registry and was finally able to recommend to the Station agenent a reduction of one Registry clerk. The smaller staff cas certainly required a more intensive work effort on the part of Registry personnel, which has been attained without any loss of morale; in fact, quite the reverse..

Subject, therefore, emerges as a records management officer who has thoroughly learned his business and a hard-driving, sympathetic and successful supervisor. In the opinion of the Station management, Subject is already quite capable of taking ovor broader and more senior responsibilities in the records manage- ment field. In this respect, however, we do not believe he will.. be wasting his time in London by spending, as he currently plans to do, an additional year here on the completion of his tour in November. The London Registry, reflecting the multi-faceted work of the Station, is sufficiently complex an operation to warrant

Subject's continued attention.

-2-

In view of his really excellent performance and high promise, it is strongly recommended that Subject be promoted to GS-11.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

ATTENTION: DDP/OP

SUBJECT: Request for Quality Step Increase
for Mr. James S. Woods, GS-09

1. On the basis of the information presented below, it is recommended that a Quality Step Increase be approved for Mr. James S. Woods.

2. Mr. Woods entered on duty with the Agency in April 1952 as a GS-03- Records and File Clerk assigned to RID. Since that time Mr. Woods has served as a Records Analyst at Headquarters, in Korea and Atsugi, Manila, and since 1961 in the Central Registry Section of the Tokyo Station. Mr. Woods is 37 years old and has been in grade as a GS-00 since 1958.

3. Mr. Woods' exceptional performance is described by the Tokyo Station as follows:

"A. Mr. Woods is now on his second tour as Chief of the Tokyo Station Registry. This unit is located at Fuchu Air Station and handles all correspondence for all Station elements. In view of the fact that the Station is located in five different geographic locations, a great deal of responsibility is given to Mr. Woods to ensure that action responsibility on incoming cables is rapidly and properly assigned, dispatches are correctly routed and processed, correspondence from other local military agencies is correctly analyzed and routed, the twice-a-day courier system is functioning effectively, and the Station flexowriter is rapidly churning out priority dispatch traffic.

"B. The Registry is presently composed of six employees in addition to Mr. Woods, who is Chief of this unit. Mr. Woods does an exemplary job in supervising these employees with the result that the Station Registry is a smooth and well-functioning unit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 257

"C. In addition to his normal duties, Mr. Woods is constantly thinking of ways to increase the efficiency of the Station Registry, and to be of greater assistance to the Station as a whole. Several of his ideas have been adopted by the Station with a resulting increase in effectiveness. His positive approach to all problems and his cheerfulness and willingness to perform any task have benefited both the Station and the Agency.

"D. In view of Mr. Woods' demonstrated ability to provide leadership to the Station Registry unit, his positive approach to the solution of the many problems which daily beset this unit, it is strongly recommended that he be promoted from GS-09 to GS-10 at the earliest opportunity."

4. Mr. Woods has continued to perform in an over-all "Strong" manner as indicated in his recent fitness report. He recently planned and effectively implemented the move of the Cable Secretariat from one location to another. In a dispatch, dated 22 November 1965, the present Chief of Station, Tokyo, stated, "There is little I can add to my predecessor's recommendation, dated 9 November 1964, for promotion of Mr. Woods. He is performing his duties as Chief of the Tokyo Station Registry with efficiency and dispatch. He is a strong supervisor who constantly strives to achieve the maximum economy in the use of his personnel and materials."

5. Consideration has been given to the granting of an Honor and Merit Award to Mr. Woods, but in this particular case it appears that a Quality Step Increase is more appropriate.

INSTRUCTIONS TO APPOINTING OFFICER

The appointing officer before signing the foregoing certificate is made shall determine that applicant is not outside the age limits have been established for the position. It should be in conformance with the Civil Service Act, applicable Civil Service Rules and Regulations and all acts of Congress pertaining to appointment. This form should be checked for posting of office, pension, suitability to ever person with any record of previous dismissal or arrest, and particularly for the following:

(1) Identity of appointee – It is the duty of the appointing officer to guard against impersonation and to determine beyond reasonable doubt that the person named appointee was authorized. The appointee’s signature and statement are to be compared with the application before other pertinent papers. If the appointee qualified in a written examination, the signature on this form should be compared with the signature on the examination sheet, which must be opened in the examination room. His photograph and medical certificate may be checked against the medical history for agreement with his previous statements.

(2) Age - If definite age limits have been established for the position, it should be determined that applicant is not outside the age range for the appointment, and until such determination is made, the appointment may not be consummated.

(3) Citizenship – The appointing officer is responsible for observing the citizenship provisions of (1) the Civil Service Rules and (2) the appropriation acts. Form 61 constitutes satisfactory color for both purposes and is acceptable proof of citizenship status in the absence of conflicting evidence. In doubtful cases the appointment should not be consummated until reassurance has been secured from the certifying office of the Civil Service Commission.

(4) Members of Family – Section 9 of the Civil Service Act provides that wherever there are already two or more members of a family serving under continued or permanent appointment in the competitive service, no other member of such family is eligible for probation, or permanent appointment in the competitive service. The appointments of persons entitled to veterans preference are not subject to this requirement. Doubtful cases may be referred to the appropriate office of the Civil Service Commission San document.

The principal object of this study is to examine the influence of changes in the level and distribution of income on changes in the birth rate in Chile during the period 1940-1960. The decision to limit the study to one country, Chile, makes it possible to isolate the effects of socio-cultural and institutional factors on fertility. The choice of the period 1940-1960 reflects the need to make use of census information on income distribution in Chile which is available only for those years. Also, during the period 1940-1960, Chile experienced a sharp decline in its birth rate. This decline, which is one of the most dramatic recorded in Latin America, warrants an analysis of the factors that may have contributed to it.

This study is based on the assumption that the birth rate is jointly determined by economic and noneconomic factors. In this context, the influence of changes in the level and distribution of income on fertility is analyzed, taking into account changes in some non-economic factors such as the level of education, urbanization, and infant mortality.

The importance of considering the influence of income distribution on fertility is derived from the fact that the demand for children is highly sensitive to the relative income position of families. It is postulated that the relative income position is more important than the absolute level of income in determining the desired number of children.

This study is organized as follows: Chapter I presents a theoretical model which analyzes the influence of changes in the level and distribution of income on fertility. Chapter II provides the statistical data to test the theoretical model outlined in Chapter I. Finally, Chapter III presents the estimates of the statistical model for Chile and analyzes their implications.
