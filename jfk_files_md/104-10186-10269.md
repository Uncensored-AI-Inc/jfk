Headquarters Comments

1.  Although source saw Julian NOVAS Fernandez at the Cuban

    assuming that NOVAS was assigned to that Embassy and
    it is more likely that he was just passing through.

    this conclusion.

arrival may be delayed in view of NOVAS' present inclination for
feminine diversion.

3. In a report dated March 1964, this same source said that
   Julian NOVAS Fernandez, the Cuban Commercial Attache at the
   Cuban Consulate in Kingston, Jamaica, was born on 2 September 1938,
   in Habana, Cuba. He carried diplomatic passport D/64/90 which
   was issued in Habana on 20 February 1964. His home address was

   via MÃ©xico. Her name is Amarilis Marta VALDES Hijuelos and
   she was born on 19 May 1937, in Jiquani, Oriente, Cuba. VALDES
