1. A letter dated 7 May 1967 has been received from Silvia HEREDIA, 180 S.E. 13th Terrace, Miami, Florida, via the ANTIKI-1 facility. Mrs. HEREDIA is the widow of Jorge FUNDORA Fernandez (Hero & Martyr, no 201 number) who is the Subject of Case #103 for which a monthly AMBUD payment of $175.00 is made to the widow. In her letter, which is attached, Mrs. HEREDIA requests the AMTIKI facility to also send the payment formerly received from AMBIDDY-1 which she claims was terminated in April 1967.

2. This case was one of three cases for which AMBIDDY. requested in January 1967 that WOFACT assume tho monthly payments being made by his organization. The request by AMBIDDY was the Subject of Reference A which requested data from JMWAVE concerning the cases. The JMWAVE reply, forwarded under Reference B, included a recommendation that no increase in payment be made. Reference C informed the addressee that, under the circumstances, it was not possible for Headquarters to take any action to provide support to the individuals concerned.

3. In view of the background described above, we propose, with Headquarters approval, to have AMTIKI-1 reply to Mrs. HEREDIA stating that no funds are available in addition to the $175.00 monthly payment which is being made.

4. We are also enclosing copies of the following documentation which has been provided by Mrs. HEREDIA:

Miami, May 7, 1967

Sirs:

By menns of these lines I wish to tell you of my present situation with the hope that you can help me.

My name is Silvia HEREDIA, widow of Jorge FUNDORA, and I have been receiving from you a pension of $175.00 monthly. Since this sum was insufficient to cover the needs of my two children, Eduardo who is 8 years old and Raquel who is 7 years old, and the psychiatric treatment for myself, AMBIDDY-1, in the name of the , sent me $125.00 monthly. In the month of August 1966, that amount (from the ) was reduced to $100.00 for economic reasons and in the month of Apt April 1967 I was notified that this amount would be suspended entirely and that I should not count on this subsidy in the future.

My situation cannot be sustained because due to my health I am not able to work at the moment and I am turning to you with the request that the sum suspended by the which was sent to me AMBIDDY-1 by be assigned to me by you.

Respectfully,
Silvia Heredia Vda. de Fundora

180 SE 14 Terrace

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT: Status Report - Transfer of AMBUD Survivor Benefit Payments to BEC

1.  Mr. Bon DeFelice, Chief, Benefits and Services Division, was phoned on 8 May for a reading on the status of the AMBUD case, i.e., researching the possibility of transferring Survivor Benefit payments (which total close to $500,000.00 per year) to the Bureau of Employee Compensation.

2.  Mr. DeFelice assured WH/COG that whatever could be done was being done and a decision on the feasibility of the turnover was being made by the Director, BEC. Sample Survivor cases had been submitted to BEC for review along with the proposed text of a letter which would be addressed to the BEC by the DCI once the course to be followed was agreed upon by both parties. The draft letter had been prepared by Mr. Lawrence Houston.

3.  Mr. DeFelice will advise WH/COG as soon as he has word.

SUBJECT: TYPIC/AMBIDDY/AMBUD
Support for Dependents of Operational Personnel

FOR YOUR INFORMATION

REFERENCE: INMA 3798, dated 28 March 1967

1. When Wallace A. GROWERY met with AMBIDDY/1 on 13 January 1967 to formally terminate the AMWORLD operation, AMBIDDY/1 discussed in detail reference dependents who had been receiving financial assistance from ANWORLD funds and requested that GROWERY explore the possibility of WOFACT financial assistance following termination of their AMWORLD monthly support payments. An investigation was conducted by both JMWAVE and Headquarters to determine if the agents named by AMBIDDY/l had been employed by WOFACT in order to determine what, if any, obligation might exist to provide financial assistance to the dependents. The results of the combined Headquarters investigation, keyed to reference dependents, are summarized below for Station Managua information.

(IDEN A) Subject was a WOFACT agent under contract. His MOC provided payment of his $400 monthly salary to his dependent parents for two years following pos- sible death while engaged on a WOFACT mission. After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received his regular monthly salary until 28 June 1963. At that time Headquarters decided to liquidate the remaining balance of $6400 and paid this amount in a lump sum to the parents. Headquarters considers that all legal and moral obligations have been discharged and is not inclined to assume any further financial obligations to the parents. AMBIDDY/1 is apparently unaware that the parents have received approximately $10,000 from WOFACT.

(IDEN B) Although IDEN C, the husband of IDEN B, was never directly employed by WOFACT, IDEN B receives $175 per month as a dependent HEROES/MARTYRS widow under the AMBUD program and has been paid a total of $10,850 from March 1962 to date through the JMWAVE/AMBUD cover mechanism. Presumably AMBIDDY/1 is unaware that this dependent has been receiving regular AJEUD assistance in addition to the $125 per month received from AMWORLD funds.

(IDEN D) AMBIDDY/1 provided GROWERY with the complete name and details of the activities of IDEN D's husband prior to his arrest and subsequent 6-30 year prison sentence. With this information traces were run on Subject with negative results. Since neither JMWAVE nor Headquarters records produced any evidence Subject had ever been a WOFACT employee, no obligation exists to provide financial assistance to IDEN B.

2. Although reference indicates the discussion between James D. ZABOTH and Ernest A. LUSBY took place after AMBIDDY/1's conversation with GROWERY in January, it is not clear when, or by whom, the subject was originally brought to ZABOTTI's attention. If AMBIDDY/1 was the source of ZABOTH's information it is noteworthy that he apparently neglected to mention his prior detailed discussion with GROWERY.

3. Under the circumstances, it is not possible for Headquarters to take any action to provide support to these individuals.

FROM: Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT: TYPIC/AMBUD/Operational Documentation for Hero and Martyr Dependency Cases

ACTION REQUIRED. REFERENCES:

Reference: UFGW-6440, 8 March 1967

1. A review of Station and AMTIKI files confirms a total lack of legal documentation for the Hero and Martyr cases as anticipated by Headquarters in Reference. A report prepared by AMTIKI-1, which is forwarded herewith, describes the content of his files for these cases and includes a copy, where available, of the authorization upon which payment is based.

2. Although the review of Station records for legal documents was unproductive, the following background data was noted as of possible interest to Headquarters in the processing of these problem cases:

a. Children included as dependents:

Case #95: one child (in U.S.A.) Total monthly payment $25.00

" #97: two children " " " " 250.00

" #98: one child " " " " 100.00

b. Cases Involving Trustees:

The only instance of a trustee is Case #99 for which AMOT-186 (201-726322) receives a monthly payment of $66.00 for the widows of Luis MENDEZ and Julio CASIELLES, both of whom are in Cuba. The turstee is not a full-time AMOT and has his own business interests locally. JMWAVE records

Indicate that this situation developed from a prior event in Cuba and that several of the Hero and Martyr cases are connected by the personalities involved. UFGA-8317, 1 April 1963, describes four of the several individuals who were involved with AMLEMON-1 in a sabotage attempt against the Cuban Electric Company on 30 November 1960. The four all form employees of the Electric Company, were captured while attempting to oscape from Cuba in a small boat following the sabotage:

William LE SANTE
Luis MENDEZ
Julio CASIELLES Amigo
Armando RODRIGUEZ Vizcaino

LE SANTE 14 the Subject of Case #106 (Hero and Martyr) who was executed as a result of his participation in the sabotage attempt. MENDEZ and CASTELLES, the Subjects of Case #99, were also executed on the same charges. RODRIGUEZ was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment which is being served in the Isle of Pinos Prison.

The Trustee describes himsolf, in the HEW Survey form, as a former employee of the Cuban Electric Company and a friend of the Subjects of Case #99. He is mentioned in a 26 September 1962 AMOT roport (AA-812; UFG-01672,.. 12 Oct. '62) as residing in Miami where he received letters, containing information, from source Martha RAMOS Castro in Havana, Traces, show-RAMOS to be the wife of Armando RODRIGUEZ and the sister-in-law of the widow of Julio CASIPLLES. The trusteo statod in the HEW Survey form that one year previously he forwarded the accumulated funds and started sending $33.00 each month to RAMOS in Chicago, per instructions by the CASIELLES widow, and that in May 1965 he stopped sending the $33.00 payment for the MENDEZ widow to Cuba and started holding it for her. He claimed to have $165.00 on hand at time of the Survey. It is noted that JMWAVE records contain no mention of payment on behalf of Armando RODRIGUEZ. The payments on behalf of LE SANTE, MENDEZ, and CASIELLES appear to be based upon letters from the COMANDO ELECTRICO DE LIBERACION which are included with the ANTIKI attachment.

In view of the Caso #99 widows boing in Cuba, and the failure of the trustee to provide the exact date-of-birth for the widows in his 9 December 1966 reply to AMTIKI (UFGA-26626, 15 December 1966), it is not believed that he would have the needed documents. We are, however, through AMTIKI-1 requesting the trustee to provide an explanation of his handling of the payments for both widows, and, via his means of communication with them, to obtain the required documentation.

c. Logality of marriages:

None of the widows/wives who provided information for the HEW Survey described their status as anything but wife or widow. The PHS form for the Subject of Case #97 provides date of marriage as 19 March 1954.

d. V Operational Relationship with Subject:

Case #95: No record of use by WOFACT. Traces reflect membership HDM and/or MRR in Cuba. Tried on 19 April 1961 for crime against the Powers of the State and possession explosives and inflammable materials. (UFGA-1162, page 464, 29 May 1962)

# March 20, 1967

SUBJECT: Review of Certain Hero and Martyr Case Files

The "Heroes and Martyrs" cases were not considered-under the same regulations as the dependents of the invaders of the Bay of Pigs. The persons suposed to receive payment were designated, in some cases by "the Department" and in other cases by the C.R.C. through its executives.. There are cases in which a written memorandum was given to us but there are others in which no memorandum was given. We were instructed to pay no more than $175.00 monthly to each, and as it can be seen, many cases are receiving lower amount a and never the amount of dependents was taking in considera- tion. There is only one case receiving a higher amount, Mrs. Hilda R. Carballo (widow of Jesus Delgado), who receives $250.00 because we were specially instructed to pay this amount.

In regards to documents, the files are very poor, and they mostly have only letters informing changes of address.

Support for Dependents of Operational Personnel

FOR YOUR INFORMATION

REFERENCE: HNMA 3703, dated 28 Merch 1967

1.  When Wallace A. GROMERY met with AMBIDDY/1 on 13 January 1967 to formally terminate the AMWORLD operation, AMBIDDY/1 discussed in detail reference dependents who had been receiving financial assistance from AMWORLD funds and requested that GROWERY explore the possibility of WOFACT financial assistance following termination of their AMWORLD monthly support payments. An investigation was conducted by both JIMAVE and Headquarters to determine if the agents named by AMDIDDY/1 had been employed by WOFACT in order to determine what, if any, obligation might exist to provide financial assistance to the dependents. The results of the combined Headquarters investigation, keyed to reference dependents, are summarized below for Station Managua information.

(IDEN A) Subject was a WOFACT agent under contract. His HOC provided payment of his $400 monthly salary to his dependent parents for two years following possible death while engaged on a WOFACT mission. After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received his regular monthly salary until 23 June 1963. At that time Headquarters decided to liquidate the remaining balance of $6400 and paid this amount in a lump sum to the parents. Headquarters considers that all legal and moral obligations have been discharged and is not inclined to assume any further financial obligations to the parents. AMBIDDY/1 is apparently unaware that the parents have received approximately $10,000 from WOFACT.

(IDEN B) Although IDEM C, the husband of IDEN B, was never directly employed by FOFACT, IDEN B receives $175 per month es a dependent HEROES/MARTYRS widow under the AMBUD program nad has boun paid a total of 310,850 from March 1062 to date through tho JMWAVE/ANDUD cover mechanism. Ireourably AMBIDDY/1 is unntare that this depondent has been receiving regular ANBUD assistanco in addition to the $125 por month received from AMWORLD funds.

(IDEN D) AMBIDDY/1 provided GROWERY with the complete namo and details of the activitios of IDEN D's husband prior to his arrost and subsequent 6-30 year pri- son sentence. With this information traces vere run on Subject with negative results. Since neither JMWAVE nor Headquarters records produced any evidence Subject had ever boon a WOPACT employee, au obligation exists to provide financial assistance to IDEM B.

2. Although referenco indicates the discussion between Jamen D. ZABOTH and Ernest A. LUSSY took place after ABIDDY/i's conver- sation with GROWERY in January, it is not clear when, or by whow, the subject was originally brought to ZABOTU's attention. If AMBIDDY/1 was the source of ZANOTH's information it is noteworthy that he apparently neglected to mention his prior detailed dis- cussion with GROWERY.

3. Under the circumstances, it is not possible for Headquarters to take any actice to provide support to these individuals.

Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT: TYPIC/AMBUD/OPERATIONAL
Concerning Dependent Payment for Jorgo KIM Yum (Case #143)

REFERENCE: UFGA-26771, 17 January 1967
ACTION REQUIRED: As stated in paragraph three

1. Blographic data concerning the paronts of Subject (201-298852)
   has been received from the trustee, Raul SANTOVENIA, and is forwarded
   herewith as Attachment A.

2. A review has been made of JMWAVE, ANTIKI, and AMOT filos
   concerning continued justification for the payment of $225.00 por
   month to the trustee on behalf of the paronts in Cuba. Significant
   points resulting from the review aro as follows:

a. Subject was executed for a prior crime in Cuba
and not because of participation at the Bay of Pigs.
(Murder of a Cuban soldier during oscape from Cuba in
March 1960). See "Bohemia" clipping forwarded herewith
as Attachment B.

b. The father of Subject, Podro KIM, is probably
identical to one Pedro KIM who is alloged by ANTIKI-1
to be an active communist in Cuba. A Pedro KIM is also
described as an active communist in the following reports:
DCE-15460, 16 August 1962; DCE-15946, 26 October 1962.

c. Although it appears that the trustee has efficiently
handled the funds forwarded to him ($12,602.00 in bank
account as of December 1965), thoro is no evidence that
any form of assistance has boon provided to the depondents
in Cuba.

3. In view of the background of this case, as described in
   paragraph 3 above, it is recommended that all payments for this
   case be terminated.

DR. MANUEL F. ARTIME

Estilado Diaz,

Adjunto le envio el Memorándum sobre tres casos de que se habla hoy.

Personalmente:

## MANUEL GUILLOT:

Este señor es el padre de Manuel Guillot Costantini, miembro del Movimiento, que trabajo para el MRI y para la "COMPANIA" durante los años 1961, 1962 y 1963 hasta el 30 de Agosto de 1963 en que fue fusilado por la Tiranía de Fidel en Cuba.

Fue torturado y muerto sin decir el nombre de los Instructores del Desembarque Corsano que el conocía. Fue infiltrado en Cuba por la "Compañía" varias veces, en una de ellas viajo con Virginia CASTELLANOS Handal de Guillot en que fue fusilado.

Don Manuel Guillot padre tiene 68 años de edad, es espástico, necesita ayuda para periatica y solo se mueve con aparatos ortopédicos. Este pobre viejo viajo a nuestra Sección México y su mujer es invalida. Nosotros le estábamos pasando $300.00 mensuales para que viera la forma en que este hombre pueda hacer otro trabajo que al que hacia de oficinista. Hay que atenderle a tres operaciones quirúrgicas y el médico dice que necesita una mano !!

## SILVIA HEBEKIA:

Es la viuda de Jorge Furqora, el que desembarco en parte de armas y "Jefe de Infiltración" que fueron a Cuba por la Sección de Bahía de Cochinos.

Esta pobre mujer esta sola en el mundo con dos niños. Ella esta recibiendo tratamiento Psiquiatra con El MRI le pasa 125 dólares mensuales. Ella no puede abandonar su negocio con los dos hijos para ir a trabajar. Su esposo fue fusilado el 12 de Octubre de 1962 y murió sin decir el punto por donde entraban las armas y los nombres de la "Compañía" en Cuba.

## ROSA FARRAS:

Es la esposa de Francisco Echeverria Palomaresque. Hace 8 años a 30 años de Presidio por los esbirros rojos. Esta mujer necesita ayuda para vivir en esa casa para mantenerse ella y los dos niños que tiene. No le es suficiente el MRI le daba $150.00 dólares mensuales. Este hombre (su esposo) trabajo intensamente con la gente de Francisco y transportando las armas que la "Compañía" metía en Cuba.

En todos estos casos que son desesperados, el MRI ha tratado hasta 100 tratamientos mágicos.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 57

DR. MANUEL F. ANTIME

(.)

Para la mayor tranquilidad de los hombres que han colaborado con este *Comite*, seria conveniente que esta gente no pasaran hambre y advertirle ya a sus parientes muertos.

O prenda hombres que han servido lealmente a la CO.PE.I. y le den objetos de valor y de abnegacion; bien distinto de los *héroes* de hoy que van a la televisión cubana cuando son capturados para hablar mal de la causa anti-comunista de 105. EMI. y vida en *KUKANIA*.

Es lo único que me preocupa de la nueva situacion cubana a partir de:

Enero de 1959.

1. A REVIEW OF THE SAMPLE HEROES/MARTYRS FILES NO. 100-130
   FORWARDED IN REFERENCE INDICATES A SERIOUS LACK OF LEGAL
   DOCUMENTS SUCH AS MARRIAGE AND BIRTH CERTIFICATES, POWERS OF
   ATTORNEY, ETC., WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH LEGALITY
   OF DEFENDENTS' SUPPORT CLAIMS.

2. IN VIEW OF THE GOOD POSSIBILITY HEADQUARTERS WILL BE
   ABLE TO TRANSFER ALL, OR A LARGE PART, OF THESE SURVIROR BENEFIT
   PAYMENTS TO BEC, IT IS REQUESTED THAT ANTIKI REVIEW ALL CASE
   FILES PERTAINING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HEROES/MARTYRS GROUP
   WHOSE DEPENDENTS ARE PRESENTLY RECEIVING MONTHLY SUFFORT PAYMENTS.
   IN THE EVENT THE FILES DO NOT CONTAIN THE REQUIRED TYPE OF LEGAL
   DOCUMENTS, ANTIKI SHOULD REQUEST COPIES OF ALL SUCH AVAILABLE
   DOCUMENTS FROM THE DEPENDENTS, SINCE DOCUMENTS CONCERNING
   MARRIAGE, BIRTHS AND BAPTISMS ARE CUSTOMARILY CHERISHED AND
   RETAINED BY FAMILIES, THERE APPEARS TO BE AN EXCELLENT CHANCE
   THAT THEY CAN BE OBTAINED. IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIMILAR

THE AMTIKI RECORDS PERTAINING TO THESE INDIVIDUALS APPEAR
TO BE MORE COMPLETS, THE NEED TO COMPILE THE NECESSARY LEGAL

AT THIS TIME.

3. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT AMTIKI NOT BE ADVISED OF

   INDICATION THAT A TURNOVER TO ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY IS

BUBJECT: Samples of 2506 Brigade Working Piles

1. Following the 10 February moeting in your office with the Director of BEC, Btation Miami was requested to send a representative group of files concerning deceased, missing and imprisoned Cuban Brigade wombers and their dependente eho are presently receiving monthly support payments.

2. Attached in one of the oight files received from Miami for your review. Since all the documents are in Spanish, a resume of those documents considered to be most important for establishing the legal rolationship between the deceased and his dopondents has boon attached for your convenience.

3. An identical resume will be made of the documents in the remaining seven files in order that they may also be reviewed whenever it is convenient for you to schedule a moeting. We may logically assume that a certain numbor of the remaining files will be lacking some of the vital documente included in the attached file. If these documents are required to meet BEC criteria on an individual basis, they could be obtained in practically all cases from those dependents, who reside in the United States.

4. The attached file is a rathor impressive example of the typo of documented proof we can submit for BEC ocrutiny; perhaps wo can avoid having to run the gauntlet on an individual basis.

Possible Release of Certain AMBUD Prisoners

For Your Information

A. UPGA 26880, 21 January 1967
B. UPGA 26912, 3 February 1967

1. Both Headquarters and ANTIKI files reflect Subject of para 2(k), reference B (prisoner #37 on reference A list) is indeed a prisoner, not deceased.

2. It is suggested that ANTIKI be requested to review the file for any indication Subject of para 2(a), reference B (prisoner #32 on reference A list) may actually be a prisoner, not deceased as reported.

3. Subject of para 3, reference B (prisoner #36 on reference A list) is a prisoner. Although he is officially listed as a GARCIA LINES crewman, he may also have been one of the Brigade personalities who served as an auxiliary crewman on one of the GARCIA LINES ships lost in the invasion.. The dependents of these deceased and imprisoned crewmen are paid by the GARCIA LINES through a special WOFACT funding mechanism. This also applies to the AMBUD-3 case, Faustino MARTINEZ, who receives $300 per month as a permanent disability case. CELENZA will no doubt recall that during MARGANY's recont TDY to JMWAVE to review the AMBUD dependency cases, MARGANY advised that all GARCIA LINES dependents would be included in the proposed recommendations for future financing of AMBUD dependency payments. Both Subject of para 3, reference B, and Faustino MARTINEZ wore included in the recently comploted- actuarial study to determine the total amount of money required to finance future dependency payments under a proposed trust fund mechanism.

2.  For Headquarters information, the monthly dependent payment of $175.00 was sent to Margarita ROQUE rather than the former trustee, Mr. Antonio Da CRUZ, effective with the January 1967 payment instead of the February 1967 payment, as stated in paragraph 2.a. of Reference.

1. In accordance with the paragraph 2, Reference A request for clarification of Case No. 123, a review has been made of JMWAVE records and the following pertinent date is forwarded for Headquarters information:

a. There is no record of Subject's mother being designated as a dependent and it is believed that the AMTIKI-1 request for biographic data concerning her (paragraph 2(a), Reference B) was an error resulting from the large number of similar investigations being handled at that time.

b. The monthly payment to the Trustee conforms with the Reference C authorization by Headquarters for termination of the $50.00 per month child dependent payment and for the continued payment of $175.00 per month for the widow as the remaining sole dependent.

2. In conclusion, the Headquarters records for this Case would appear to be correct and our error in correspondence is regretted.

Dear Mr. Garcia:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated December 30, 1966 and January 27, 1967 which contained information concerning the six beneficiaries currently receiving compensation. We are grateful for this information.

With regard to Mr. Alfonso Alberti Garcia, our records show that he completed his rehabilitation training in June 1965 which qualified him as a radio/ television repairman. In other words, he has a marketable skill which can provide him with employment.

We would appreciate it if you would terminate the monthly payment of $275.00 to Mr. Alberti as of March 1, 1967. Please advise Mr. Alberti that since his rehabilitation training and a lengthy period of grace to find employment he will no longer receive any payments. If he should need any social or financial assistance, you might suggest that he apply to a local, state or national welfare agency.

Please keep us advised of any further developments in this case.

Very truly yours,

David B. Challerton

2. The following data is keyed to the case numbers in Attachment No. 1 to Reference B:

a. Case #120: 201-293759. The listing of Subject in attachment No. I to Reference B as deceased resulted in the September 1966 termination of payment to the trustee account for which AMTIKI-l is responsible. We do not plan to make any changes in this account at this time.

b. Case #124: 201-285171. Monthly payment of $225.00 to wife

Benefit Payments to BEC

PARTICIPANTS: Ben DeFelice, Chief/Personnel Benefits
and Services, Office of Personnel
James Ueberhorst, Office of General
Counsel
Nancye Gratz, WH/COG
Walter T. Cini, WH/COG/EXO

1. Reviewed a large number of possibilities on the pros and cons of going to BEC on 2 February 1967.

2. DeFelice feels we have conceived a sufficient number of alternatives to contact BEC directly and discuss.

3. A meeting is to be set up next week, possibly 6 February, to discuss with Mr. Tinsley, Director of Bureau of Employees Compensation, who cleared, friendly and very helpful, with regard to BEC accepting one of the following solutions:

a. Takeover of all or most of the funding of the regular payments, after he has had a chance to review the files. The Agency would continue to distribute the payments through cover (there is a precedent in the HEW arrangement). This would not create a BEC problem according to DeFelice.

b. BEC takes over the majority under present arrangement and the Agency continues to handle those cases which do not qualify under BEC regulations.

c. The BEC pays a lump sum to the Agency fund which would continue the payments at the present rate and under the present system-until all cases are terminated.

4. One of the most serious problems facing us at present is the five-year statute of limitations. One way to get around this claim would-be-for-the Agency to issue a statement to the effect that, after the elapse of five years, it is prepared to make a statement of presumptive or conclusive finding of death.

The Agency has the authority to make such a statement. The BEC could accept the statement as sufficient grounds but would probably require a half-yearly statement prolonging its validity.

5. Anticipated problems:

a. BEC will require proof of relationship between the deceased or missing and the beneficiary which may not be available or procurable in all cases.

b. The BEC has a base salary rate of $240 minimum which is a higher rate than many of the present payments.

c. If the BEC allocation on the other hand were lower, we could "construct" a salary to up the payment over $240.

d. Whatever the rate of GARCIA LINES payments, they are based on legal maritine compensation rates.

e. The survivor beneficiary in a student status may present a special problem.

1. In accordance with Chief of Station, JMWAVE and Stefan R. LABANOW's telephone conversation on 25 January 1967, we do not plan to take the action requested in the References prior to Headquarters reconsideration of the cases, based on information obtained from a further review of our récords.

2. Manuel GUILLOT Castellanos (201-281397). With reference to paragraph 2.A. of Reference B., it is recommended that Headquarters consider the following points in favor of the JMWAVE proposal that no further obligation exists to the dependents of Subject and that payments should not be resumed.

a. Financial: The 1 March 1961 MOC established a monthly salary of $200.00 per month, payable to GUILLOT's parents during the time he was in Cuba. The 31 October 1961 amendment to the MOC provided for a salary of $400.00 per month, payable to GUILLOT's parents during the time he was in Cuba. Further, the NOC provided for 2 years payment of salary to the parents from the date of death if due to operational activities. (Executed 30 August 1962). The 18 April 1962 amendment to the MOC provided for a bonus of up to $750.00 per year if approved by the COS, JAMWAVE. In accordance with the MOC, the parents received $3,200.00 in monthly payments prior to 28 June 1963 when with Headquarters approval (UFGS-2992, 19 April 1963) the amount of $6,400.00 was accepted by them as the final settlement. This settlement represented monthly payment projected to 30 August 1964. There is no record of payments to dependents other than the parents. It is believed that the financial settlement is in accordance with current JAWAVE policy for the handling of agent death benefits. (JMWAVE Instruction 20-50). JMWAVE records contain nothing subsequent to the final settlement with the parents on 28 June 1963.

b. Operational: Subject was first contacted by a JMWAVE case officer in Miami during July 1960. The last of several missions to Cuba, dating back to 9 December 1960, was the infiltration by JUWAVE on approximately 1 May 1962. Subject was arrested on 29 May 1962 and executed on 30 August 1962.

c. Other: Subject was a friend of Manuel ARTIME prior to early 1959 when Subject joined ARTIME to form the Rural Commands. Subject resumed contact with ARTIME following Subject's arrival in Miami in 1960. Re the ARTIME claim in Reference B that the mother of Subject is in bad health, there is nothing in the filo regarding the mother's health, but mention is made of an aunt, Mrs. Eloisa CASTELLANO Rosales, who was in bad health due to liver trouble. According to JMWAVE traces Mrs. CASTELLANO entered the U.S.A. on 3 July 1963 (A13319405). In summary, it is noted that Subject was considered as a valuable asset during the period of his service. However, it is believed that the dependents have been well-paid according to JMWAVE policy, and there is no record of their dissatisfaction with the final settlement. It is further noted that a close and long-time association oxisted between Subject and Manuel ARTIME, source of the current request for financial assistance to the dependents.

3. Jorge FUNDORA (Hero and Martyr). Reference is made to paragraph 2.B. of Reference B which is concerned with the possible increase of payment to the widow, Silvia HEREDIA. There is nothing in JNWAVE records to indicate that Subject ever worked for WOFACT. However, the original AMBUD arrangement for designation of dependents eligible for benefit payments resulted in the addition of certain non-WOFACT cases to the payment rolls. Further, a review of the original HEW questionnaire shows that Mrs. HEREDIA declared her total income to be the $175.00 a month AMBUD payment. No mention was made of additional income from the MRR. Unless Headquarters has information not available to JWAVE, we strongly recommend no increase in payments be made.

4. Francisco ECHEVERRIA Texier is the Subject of paragraph 2.C., Reference B. There is nothing in JMWAVE records to indicate that Subject was ever employed by WOFACT. Unless Headquarters has additional information regarding this case it is recommended that payments not be initiated to the wife.

1. Returned, under separate cover, are recent replies to ANTIKI letters forwarded in Reference A. Please return these letters to ANTIKI for retention.

2. The 30 November letter sent to Trustee of Case No. 123 requested information concerning the mother of deceased (para- graph 3(a), Reference A). According to Case No. 123 study forwarded in. Keference C, only the widow and an unidentified child were listed as dependents. The Trustee denied the exis- tence of any child in her original letter to AMTIKI, and Reference D authorized the Station to terminate payment for this child. Deceased's 201 file contains bio data which identifies the mother as reported, but does not reflect she was designated as a dependent. Apparently, information is available at the Station which indicates the mother is the rightful second depen- dent. Clarification of this case is requested in order that Headquarters data may coincide with that recorded at JMWAVE.

3. Headquarters wishes to express appreciation for the extremely valuable biographic data forwarded to date which was essential for the now completed WUMUTUAL actuary study. The results of this study will be incorporated in recommendations for future financing of this operation which will be submitted to Higher Authority for approval in the immediate future.

PRESUMABLY, THE PROCEEDS OF THIS DEATH BENEFIT PAYMENT
HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED BY THE MOTHER'S MEDICAL EXPENSES.
HEADQUARTERS DOES NOT FEEL THAT THE DEATH BENEFIT PAYMENT
SHOULD NECESSARILY PRECLUDE FURTHER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
TO DEPENDENTS OF A FORMER VALUABLE AGENT IF IT CAN BE
PROVEN THEY WILL BE DESTITUTE AFTER THE TERMINATION OF
THE MONTHLY MRR PAYMENTS. THE INVESTIGATOR SHOULD DETERMINE
THE PRESENT FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE PEOPLE, INCLUDING
THE INCOME OF THE FATHER AND ANY CASH ASSETS, THEIR PRESENT
SCALE OF LIVING, THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF BOTH INDIVIDUALS,
AND THE MINIMUM AMOUNT REQUIRED FOR LIVING EXPENSES AND
PERMANENT MEDICAL CARE ARTIME CLAIMS THE MOTHER REQUIRES.
THIS INVESTIGATION IS EXTREMELY URGENT IN ORDER THAT A
RECOMMENDATION FOR PAYMENT OF FUNDS, OVER AND ABOVE THE
THE DEATH BENEFIT, MAY BE SUBMITTED FOR SPECIAL APPROVAL.

B. SILVIA HEREDIA, WIDOW OF JORGE FUNDORA, WHO
PARTICIPATED IN INFILTRATION OPERATIONS BOTH BEFORE AND
AFTER THE BAY OF PIGS AND WAS EXECUTED 12 OCTOBER 1961.
SUBJECT IS PRESENTLY RECEIVING $175 PER MONTH UNDER THE
AMBUD PROGRAM AS A HEROES/MARTYRS WIDOW/SEE CASE NO. 1031/.
ACCORDING TO ARTIME, SUBJECT IS UNDER PSYCHIATRIC TREAT-
MENT, WHICH IS ALSO REFLECTED IN REFERENCE CASE STUDY, AND
HAS BEEN RECEIVING $125 PER MONTH FROM THE MRR TO HELP
SUPPORT HERSELF AND HER 2 SMALL CHILDREN. REASSESSMENT
OF THE CASE IS REQUESTED TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF HARD-
SHIP THAT WILL BE IMPOSED. FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF
THE MPR ALLOWANCE AND AN ESTIMATE MADE OF THE MONTHLY
ALLOWANCE NECESSARY TΟ ΜΑΙΝΤΑΙΝ AN ADEQUATE EXISTENCE AND
MEET MEDICAL COSTS. SUBJECT'S ORIGINAL HEW QUESTIONAIRRE
SHOULD BE REVIEWED FOR ANY EVIDENCE SHE DECLARED ANY
OUTSIDE INCOME FROM THE MRR OR ANY OTHER SOURCE.

C. ROSA RABASA, WIFE OF FRANCISCO ECHEVERRIA
TEXIER, WHO ACCORDING TO ARTIME WAS ENGAGED IN TRANS-
PORTING COMPANIA ARMS UNTIL HIS CAPTURE AND SUBSEQUENT
6-30 YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. THE WIDOW, WHO IS DEAF, HAS
BEEN RECEIVING $75 PER MONTH AND PAYMENT OF HER MEDICAL
BILLS BY THE MRR TO HELP SUPPORT HERSELF AND HER 2 CHILDREN.
SHE AUGMENTS HER SMALL INCOME BY SEWING IN HER HOME.
SUBJECT'S HUSBAND IS THE INDIVIDUAL ON WHOM MARGANY
REQUESTED TELEPHONE TRACES FROM INGHURST 16 JANUARY.

3. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE SAME INVESTIGATIVE FACILITIES
   EMPLOYED IN THE REFERENCE AMBUD INVESTIGATIONS BE UTILIZED IN
   THESE CASES. FOR PLAUSIBLE COVER PURPOSES THE INVESTIGATOR
   SHOULD STATE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND FROM DR. ARTIME THAT HIS
   ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN GIVING THEM MONTHLY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
   THAT IT IS NOW PROPOSED THAT THE FIRM OF MCKIRCHER AND AVANT MAY
   BE RETAINED TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS AND CERTAIN INFORMATION IS
   NEEDED FOR THEIR RECORDS. IN ADDITION TO OBTAINING THE OTHER
   INFORMATION REQUIRED THE INVESTIGATOR SHOULD ASK THE AMOUNT OF
   THE PRESENT MONTHLY PAYMENT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO VERIFY THE
   VERACITY OF THE AMOUNTS ARTIME CLAIMS THEY HAVE BEEN RECEIVING.
   IN THE CASE OF SILVIA HEREDIA, WHO KNOWS SHE IS RECEIVING MONEY
   FROM MCKIRCHER AND AVANT, SUGGEST THE INVESTIGATOR TELL HER
   THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF HER ADDITIONAL MRR INCOME AND HAVE ΤΟ
   BRING HER PRIOR QUESTIONAIRRE UP TO DATE. ALSO, QUESTION HOW
   SHE WILL BE AFFECTED IF THE MRR PAYMENTS ARE TERMINATED.

4. SINCE MRR FUNDING WAS TERMINATED AS OF 31 DECEMBER 1966,
   AND ARTIME STATED THESE SPECIAL CASES WOULD BE LEFT IN A DESPERATE
   SITUATION, A CABLED REPORT OF INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS IS URGENTLY
   REQUESTED BY STEFAN R. LABANOW BY COB 25 JANUARY. THE ADDRESSES
   OF GUILLOT AND RABASA ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT HEADQUARTERS BUT ONE,
   MANUEL J. GUILLOT, WHO MAY BE IDENTICAL WITH CASE A, IS LISTED

Termination of Dependency Payment

REFERENCE: UPGW-6306, 8 December 1966

1. In accordance with guidance provided in the Reference con- cerning Case #94 (201-283337), the monthly payment to the first dependent (mother) Graciela LOVIROSA for the dependents of 201-283357 was adjusted by terminating the $50.00 monthly payment for the second dependent (father) in Cuba and continuing payment of $175.00 monthly to the first dependent. A letter of explana- tion prepared by the case officer was enclosed in the 31 December 1966 mailing by ANTIKI/1 of the January 1967 payment.

2. On 10 January 1967 a reply dated 2 January 1967 was re- ceived from Mrs. ROVIROSA in which resumption of the payment for the second dependent is requested. Ill health of the father and his need for assistance are cited as justification. A copy of the letter is forwarded under separate cover for Headquarters information.

3. In accordance with the recommendation contained in para- graph one of Reference, Stanley JEKSAVIT has provided the following background information on the dependents in this case which results from personal direct knowledge of the family:

The mother, Mrs. Graciela ROVIROSA, comes from one of the wealthiest, if not the most wealthy, family in Camaguey Province. She left Cuba in 1959 or 1960 in anticipation of what has happened, taking all her personal wealth with her. At the same time, her share of the family fortune was forwarded to her in the U.S. as long as this policy continued, perhaps until 1962.

Her husband, Jose A. RODRIGUEZ, did not leave with her because of a mistress in Cuba. Mrs. ROVIROSA contemplated divorce at that time but no divorce ever came about. Although the father stated numerous times that he intended to leave Cuba, and his name is on the "airlift" listing, he now states that he is not going to leave Cuba because he must stay to

supervise property that has not been confiscated by the
state. This is considered by members of the family in
the U.S. to be only an excuse for remaining in Cuba,

The father is thought to have a sizeable bank account
in the U.S. which was accrued prior to and during the
early days of the Castro regime. Although the mother has
access to the funds, she is trying to avoid use of the
funds for personal reasons.

Mrs. ROVIROSA is believed to be employed by HEW as
an IBM key-punch operator in the Refugee Center (JMWAVE
has verified the employment as key-punch operator, GS-3,
Salary $4,269.00 per annum. Employed since 14 December 1966
on a temporary basis.)

JERSAVIT has heard nothing concerning the father's
alleged 111 health. To the contrary, a sister of Mrs.
ROV IKOSA describes the husband as being very active in
Cuba and believes he may possibly have obtained a divorce
from Mrs. ROVIROSA

4. In view of the background information concerning the
   dependents in this case, JMWAVE does not plan to reply to the
   letter from Mrs. ROVIROSA.

I received your letter dated 28 December. I recently received a letter from Humberto Reyos' mother's daughter but she did not mention her mother's age (even though I had asked) I'm sure she just forgot about it. However, I am sending her address as you requested, the address is:

Mr. Flores,

This morning I received an answer from r. Alfredo Garcia, President of the GARCIA LIVE, Civing the bio data requested on dependents of the crew we are still paying. This completes the bio cata required for the actuary study.

When I called Er. Evan's office to give his secretary the above information concerning the GARCIA people, she told me the computing of the money involved was started yesterday and we may get our total figure within a week. I have the draft meno written by Mr. Millian and the new first page which I revised. As soon as we receive that big, fat figure from WULUTUAL the final como can be typed and we will be in business.

Paragraph 3.

Refererken: A. UFGA-26504 dated 8 December 1966
B. UFGA-26626 dated 15 December 1966

1. Forwarded under separate cover attachment A are the replies received in references from ANTIKI. It is requested that those letters be returned to ANTIKI for retention in individual Subject files.

2. It is recommended that ANTIKI assume responsibility for reviewing the status of minor dependents in order to autoantically terminate payments to those individuals who become 21 years of age. This should be done on a regular 30 day basis since many of these dependents will become in-eligible for payment during 1967. A list of birthdates compiled by ELLEN F. MARGANY is forwarded under separate cover attachment B to assist ANTIKI in monitoring this operation. Some procedure should also be established by ANTIKI for periodically attempting to establish proof of marriages contracted by dependents.

3. A quarterly Station report is requested on all future payment terminations in order that Headquarter's records may be maintained on a current basis.

TO : I'r. Flores

FROM: Nancye Grats

1. In order to submit accurate figures for the approved actuery study we must immediately establish some definite criteria for survivor payments in the event the principal dependent is terminated for cause.

2. I find it difficult to accept the inheritance formula that JWAVE says has been SOP, 1. e. when the first dependent is terminated the second dependent inherits the first dependent's share and so on down the line. In the first place, the Station hasn't been consistent in following this procedure and the fact it was originally established by APUD is no reason for us to continue it. Regardless of the background for this unrealistic procedure it seems that the whole matter is now at a point where policy governing future payments should be determined at the Headquarters level and the actuary study can't be started until we supply firm figures that are not subject to a variety of changes over the years. Furthermore, the Station views and clarification of the background leading to the present procedure, which was requested over a week ago, has not been forthcoming.

3, I think we can live with the following formula as it isn't too inconsistent with BEC survivorship provisions. I discussed the following with Mr. Millian who agreed the provisions seemed to be thoroughly practical and realistic if you concur.

(a) In those cases where the parents are the sole beneficiaries, in the event one dies the survivor will be paid the larger of the two payments now received, which would be 3175 instead of the $225 now received by both of them.

(b) When a widow dies or remarries, her payment will be divided equally among the surviving minor children in lieu of the graduated payments they are now receiving. This may cost us a little more than Just lopping off the widow's share and continuing the amounts presently paid to the children but we will minimize possible repercussions from the widow if she is still alive and remarried. It is also much more equitable to the children themselves to share and share alike in the event the mother dies. An additional provision should be that as each child reaches 21 or marries, his payment will be terminated, except in those cases where a child is physically or mentally incapacitated for life. In such cases the child will be paid for life.

In answer to any possible static over these provisions we can always fall back on the original cover story concerning availability of A'BUD funds.

4. May I have your opinion on the above proposal so that I can provide Wir. Evans with the statistics necessary to start the actuary study without further delay?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:
Minutes of the WUMUTUAL Investment Committee Meeting Held on 7 December 1966

REFERENCE:
Agenda for the Subject Meeting

*Minutes of meeting were ratified 6 Jan 1967*

1.  The Subject meeting was held in the DD/S Conference Room at 10:30 a.m. on 7 December 1966. All members of the Committee were present. Also attending were the Chief, DO Division, the Committee Advisor, the WUMUTUAL Secretariat (Evans and Fielder), and Messrs. Kenneth Million and Earl Williamson and Mrs. Nancy Gratz representing WII Division. The WII representatives were present in conjunction with Item 3 of the Agenda.

2.  Mr. Houston chaired the meeting, and the first item of business discussed was Item 3 of the Agenda, i.e., WII Division's proposal of WUMUTUAL annuities for dependents of the Cuban Brigade. Mr. Million gave a summary presentation on the Brigade matter. He stated that the payments to the dependents of the Cuban Brigade have been made since 1961 under Presidential order, which order in effect stated that the payments were to be made until rescinded by the President. Since that time, the Agency has spent approximately $17,000,000 on the overall program, of which $12,000,000 represents direct stipends to the beneficiaries. WII Division's FY 1967 budget for this matter is $397,000, and currently 316 individuals are receiving payments, most of whom are dependents of the Brigade with the balance being dependents of the Heroes and Martyrs Group and certain Garcia Line crewmen. The individuals are presently paid through a cover firm with no official Government attribution. It is WII Division's position that since this program must be continued until terminated by the President, it is a long range, overall Agency obligation which should not be budgeted for nor administered by WII Division. The Division would like to transfer total responsibility for the program to Project WUMUTUAL by a single premium purchase of annuities. If the single premium method is too costly, they would still like to have the responsibility transferred either by an installment purchase or by the funding method. Mr. Evans advised the Committee that he felt the matter should be brought to the attention of the Committee before WUMUTUAL secured actuarial calculations, since the fees for these calculations will be fairly expensive. After considerable discussion, the Committee concluded that while the

- 2 -

chances are remote of securing sufficient funds from the Bureau
of the Budget to establish an annuity program, the program should
be costed on several alternative bases, including a single premium
charge, installment basis and delayed implementation of the program.
When the cost study is completed, alternative proposals may be
submitted for consideration within the Agency and to the Bureau of
the Budget, if deemed appropriate. As soon as WH Division provides
UMUTUAL with the additional information required, MUTUAL will
request the study from its actuarial consultants.

3. After this matter was considered by the Committee, the
   representatives left the meeting. The Chairman then proceeded
   to handle the other Agenda Items. The Minutes of the 15 November
   1966 meeting, the last meeting preceding this one, were ratified.

Recommendations for Termination of Certain Dependency Payments

ACTION REQUIRED: See paragraph 3

REFERENCE : UPGA-25261, dated 3 June 1966

1. It is recommended that JEWAVE arrange to notify specific AMBUD dependents that certain payments will be terminated as of 1 January 1967. The cases, and the reasons for such terminations, are listed below by case number corresponding to Reference Attachment #1.

Case # 3

Terminate payments to 2nd and 3rd dependents, daughters of Benito BLANCO Cruz. Both daughters are over 21 years of age.

Case # 4

Terminate 2nd and 3rd dependents, married brothers of Manuel BLANCO Navarro and substitute the father, Manuel BLANCO Canisal, as 2nd dependent.

Case # 6

Terminate payment to 2nd dependent of Daniel FERNANDEZ Hon and pay only $175 to mother, Lucia EON Fuertes.

Case 16.

Terminate payments to 2nd and 3rd dependents, parents of Benjamin QUINTANA Perera, who are apparently not receiving any financial assistance and may actually be deceased. Although there is some question regarding the legal status of 1st dependent, deceased claimed her as his wife and payment should continue until further notice.

## Case # 20

Terminate payment to 1st dependent, widow of Saul VIANELLO Alakan, as sister gave sufficient evidence of widow's remarriage to justify termination. Also terminate 5th dependent, who apparently is mother of the widow and her sister, not the mother of the deceased, and is not entitled to support money. Children will continue to receive support. Widow receives more money than is customary for a widow since her husband was a pilot. In certain cases of this type, payments were established by ALBUD, not by VOFACT.

## Case # 31

Terminate payment to 5th dependent, father of Jose CARPAZANA Trimino, unless proof can be established that father is alive and receiving support money. ANTIKI has been requested to query 1st dependent on status of father.

## Case # 50

Terminate payments to 2nd and 3rd dependents, parents of Reinaldo VIDAL Marola, if widow is unable to provide proof that parents are receiving support. ANTIKI has also been requested to investigate this caso.

## Case # 52

Terminate payment to 1st dependent, widow of Clemonte CRUZ de la Torre, who advised of re-marriage in 1964. Children will continue to receive support.

## Case # 53

Terminate payments to 1st and 2nd dependents, widow and child of Marcelo NAPOLSS Viquiera. 4th dependent advised that widow and child moved to Houston on 19 November 1959. Widow, whose name is Sue Elizabeth Lessmann and probably a US citizen, apparently was separated from husband before his death. There is no indication that Trustee has sent any money to widow.

## Case # 59

Terminate payment to 2nd dependent, eldest daughter of Vicente LEON Leon, who was born 26 October 1945 and is now over 21 years of age.

## Case # 61

Terminate payment to 4th dependent, youngest daughter of Marcelo CARMENATE Cebrian, who is now married and not entitled to support.

## Case # 63

Terminate payment to 4th dependent, father of Mario GALVEZ Lopez, who apparently receives no support money.

continued.........


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 130

SECRET UPGW-6306

Case # 65

Terminate payments to Trustee since widow, legal child and parents of Antonio FADRON Cardenas, not receiving entire amount to which they are entitled if Trustee is sending $100 to two mistresses. If, and when, widow does come to the USA, case can be reviewed for possible renewal of direct payments to widow and arrange- ments made to pay support to illegitimate daughter. Present legitimate dependents will be projected for the actuary study so that funds will be available if required at a future date.

Case # 75

Terminate payment to 2nd dependent, father of Pedro MORDA Roque, Mother of deceased is now in the USA and records indicate she is separated from the father who remained in Cuba.

Case # 78

Terminate payment to 2nd dependent, daughter of Carlos GUAS Decall, who is not only married but is over 21 years of age.

Case # 81

Terminate payment to deceased 2nd dependent, father of Osvaldo DIAZ Milian.

Case # 83

Terminate payments to 2nd and 3rd dependents, children of Pedro CULLLAR Alonso, who reside in Cuba. According to widow, she has little, if any, contact with her stepsons and does not contribute to their support on a regular basis

Case # 87

Terminate payment to 2nd dependent who is the mother of widow of Carlos SOLIS Shelton, not mother of deceased. On the questionnaire, the widow claimed her mother as dependent. According to ANTIKI, deceased's mother is Rosa SHELTON who has resided in the USA for some time and apparently has never received any money.

Case # 89

Terminate payments to 2nd and 3rd dependents, parents of Roberto PEREZ Cruzata, and 4th dependent, child of first dependent and her former husband Harry FRITZ. Probably all dependents should be terminated but there are conflicting statements concerning the legal status of the "widow". Deceased claimed her as his wife in 1961. ANTIKI's file on this case contains a letter from a Miami lawyer requesting information on the "widow" and advised he had been retained by Harry FRITZ to protect his interest and that of their daughter, Cathleen FRITZ, in view of the supposed marriage of his ex-wife and Roberto

Plata Cruzata. If the lawyer who represents FRITZ could be discreetly queried, the true status of the relationship between the "vidow" and PEREZ sight be established and lead to a termination of her payment. If JHWAVE concurs, rocommend ANTIKI bo instructed to pursuo this investigation.

## Case 92

Terginate payment to deceased 2nd dependent, mother of Herman KOCH.

## Case 94

Terminate payment to 2nd dependent, father of Jose FERNANDEZ Боvігоза, who apparently receives no support from mother of deceased. Stanley JERSANIT can supply some background on dependents in this case who are both from wealthy families.

## Case 122

Amount and method of payments to dependents in this case was directed by Headquarters and handled by Humphrey O. TIMANUS. According to the question- natre filled out by Ist dependent, father of Manuel REYES Garcia, father is not following instructions to provide for the wife and child in Cuba, as vell as provide certain conforts for his imprisoned son. It is recommended that this case be reviewed with TIMANUS and ANTIKI resumo trusteeship of funds for the vidow and child and prisoner. The father and stepmother should then be paid $25 apiece, as 3rd and 4th dependents. The remaining $225 per month would then be deposited in the existing trust account at the Coconut Grove Bank...

## Саве 131

Terminate payment to 2nd dependent, son of Jose BORRAS Gutierrez. Son, Alfredo BORRAS Macias vas born 19 April 1943 and is over 21 years of age.

2. Although the money saved by the above terminations is small in comparison to the total amount expended each month, it is a beginning which hopefully will lead to more terminations in the near future. All trusteeships are presently being reviewed and JEWAVE will advised as rapidly as possible con- cerning trusteeships to be terminated completely or adjusted. Two trusteeships that require special study concern casos 142 and 144 as follows:

## Case 142

Jorge GUTIERREZ Izaguirre designated his parents as dependents. It is recommended that the Trustee be requested to subait the names of the uncle and aunt who have possession of the bank book and obtain the exact amount of money on deposit. The uncle may be Alfredo HORNFLO, a former prominent Cuban businesszan now in the US, for whom GUTIERREZ formerly worked in Cuba. GUTIERREZ also has a

brother who is an American citizen residing in
New York. This brother, an engineer who may be
engaged in space research, recently queried NASA
concerning the possibility of obtaining assistance
to effect the release of his brother from prison.

## Case # 144

Andrew VEGA Perez originally designated his wife
and child as dependents and named another sister
as Trustee. Information obtained from ANTIKI
and various records available, indicate that VEGA
learned that his wife was a GOC follower and directed
that the present Trustce, another sister, nesume
control of the money. This could account for the
discrepancy between the amount of money now hold
in trust and the total amount of money paid from
1961-1963 since the new trusteeship was not croated
until such of the money had beon spent. In order to
protect the interests of the prisoner, some procedure
will probably be devised by which a long-range
projection can be made for actuary purposes and the
trusteeship torminated. Recommendations for handling
this cane will be submitted to JAVE in the near
future.

3. In order to arrive at the exact amount of money to
   be saved by the immediate and future tersination of paymente
   to certain dependents, a definite criteria must be established
   concerning adjustments for secondary dependents when the
   first dependent has been torminated. In discussions between
   Ellen F. MARGANY, during her recont TDT to JEWAVE, and
   Humphrey O. TIMANUS, it was MARGANY's understanding that the
   procedure is to raise the second dependent to the status
   of first dependent when the original first dépendent is
   terminated for couse. For example, the first child would
   receive the amount originally paid to the mother, instead
   of the customary $50 paid to a second dependent, and the third
   dependent would then become the second dependent and receivo
   $50 instead of the original $35. This procedure 596 not
   followed in case # 44 where the second dependent payment
   remained at $50 after the remrriage of the mother, Case
   #25 where child, now sole dependent, coes not receive full
   Ist dependent payment, nor is the contentious CUERVO-RUBIO
   case (#54) where an attempt to hold the second dependent
   to $50 précipitated considerable unpleasantness. However,
   in case 86, the procedure of raising the payment level
   of the second and third dependents after the remarriage of
   the mother, was followed. Logically, the termination of
   payments to dependents in any of the top categories vould
   automatically lead to an adjustment in status and payeont
   to not only children, but in some cases parents as well,
   depending on their position of inheritance. A clarification
   of Station's past procedure, any known committaents to
   dependents, and present views as to fira criteria to be
   followed in such cages is urgently requested. Not only is
   such a fixed criteria necessary to deteraine the amount of
   savings involved in the recommended izneciate ternication,
   and to provide accurate long-range figures for the actuary
   study, but also for the purpose of avoiding any possible
   repercussions such as occurred in the CUERVO-RUBIO case.
   Request Station cable reply.

1.  Transmitted herewith are two copies of the Quarterly Progress report for the First Quarter of FY 67 concorning the AMBUD program.

2.  As explained in the attached report, in the absence of any Headquarters approval to carry out the cost reduction plan proposed by the Station in FY 66 AMBUD expenditures are running at the rate of approximately $34,000 per month. If this rate is continued throughout FY 67, then the total cost for the year will be approximately $408,000, as compared with the $230,000 projected by the Station for the fiscal year. The Station has been kept well informed by Headquarters concerning its struggles to place the AMBUD program on a reasonable and economic basis. Until a decision is taken at the Headquarters level, the Station will continue to administer the AMBUD program under the present ground rules.

## A. Operational Highlights

1.  The AMBUD program for the handling and disposition of residual Brigade matters pertaining to dependent benefits and medical attention continued during the reporting period. All major developments were reported to Headquarters as described in the following paragraphs.

2.  The results of a survey of all persons receiving AMEUD benefits, and the JMWAVE recommendations for handling the ultimate termination of these benefits, were forwarded by UFGA-25261, 3 June 1966.

3.  The conclusion of the vocational rehabilitation program covering 63 Brigade members on 30 June 1966 was reported by UFGA-25901, 14 September 1966.

4.  The current status of the remaining six medical cases which included a request for Headquarters guidance on the disposition of these cases was prepared in September and forwarded by UFGA-26075.

## B. Administration

5.  In accordance with guidance received from Headquarters (DIRECTOR 10331, 7 June 1966), payment of benefits were to continue unchanged until further notice. During the reporting period JMWAVE received no guidance or instruction to change this basic decision by Headquarters.

6.  Expenses incurred during the reporting period are tabulated as follows:

*(Expenses for medical treatment and the payment of AMBUD-3 salary, expenses, and office space.)

C. Problems

7. The amount of $250,000.00 originally authorized for the medical phase of the AMBUD program has been almost depleted since expenditures have reached a level of approximately $220,000.00, with bills outstanding of $3,250.00. Headquarters was informed in UFGA-26075 that cases remaining which require medical treatment may necessitate the expenditure of sums in excess of the original authorization.

D. Plans for Next Quarter

8. It is expected that payment of dependent benefits and medical expenses for Brigade members will continue unchanged during the coming quarter. One possible exception would be the termination of any remaining medical cases upon release by medical authorities for return to self-supporting status.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION September 9, 1966
5:30 p. m.

SUBJECT: Manuel Artime - leader of the Bay of Pigs expedition

Artime came to see me at his own initiative. The meeting had been arranged through Congressman Dante Fascell's office. I have known Artime for several years, but had not seen him for about two years.

Artime stated that the purpose of his visit was to express some personal views about the Cuban situation. He said he fully appreciated the fact that the Cuban exile looks at his homeland in a manner quite different from United States Government with its world-wide responsibilities. Nevertheless, he thought it important that hit-and-run raids be resumed against Cuba to (1) keep up the hopes of the opposition inside the island and (2) force Fidel to maintain a high state of alert which materially subtracts from his economic efforts. Artime noted that assets to make these raids are available but are not being used. He did not specifically ask for support to resume resume his activities.

I told him that while his arguments had certain merit, there were also other considerations which should be kept in mind, 1.e., that hit-and-run ralds provido a pretext for Castro to turn the screws of repression harder on the Cuban people and to place the blame for his own failure on external attacks. Artime acknowledged the validity of these arguments and did not pursue the matter further.

Artime said that he had reached the point where he had to think of finding a job to support his wife and three children. He indicated a preference for a job that would permit him to travel throughout Latin America so that he could maintain his contacts in other countries, and asked that I let him know if I learned of any opportunities. I said I would.

The rest of our conversation ranged over a series of points -- Cubela, Rabel, Gutierrez Menoyo, Huber Matos, the status of political prisoners, Castro's security measures, mutual friends in Miami -- but he had nothing significant to say.

Toward the end of our conversation, he returned to the subjectsof ralds to volunteer his services in a leadership or subordinate capacity if the United

States Covernment decided to resume this type of activity. I told him I fully understood his deep desire to see his country freed and what great efforts he had made toward this objective, and thanked him for the offer.

He also asked that I do what I could to prevent suspension of remittance to families of those who had fought against Castro. I told him I knew nothing about this but would look into it.

In departing he expressed doop appreciation for my having given him so much time (1 hour) and for having the chance to converse with one who understood Cuba's problems and his preoccupations. This was a rather subdued and reflective Artime -- quite a contrast with the fiery and combative Artime of two years ago.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Payments to Dependents of Brigade 2506

REFERENCE: Memorandum for General Counsel, OGC 66-1663
Dated 22 July 1966 with Attachment

1. On 11 August 1966, I met with Nancye Gratz and Ken Millian (WH/C) to explore further the proposal that payments to dependents of Brigade members be reduced.

2. I was told that WH is presently expending some $255.000 per year for 144 cases of KIA's and MIA's, which figure includes the 16 still in prison on criminal charges that predate their membership in the Brigade. It was emphasized, however, that the proposed cut back would not include the 16. I also learned that the impulse for reopening this matter was a Wave dispatch (UFGA--25261; 3 June 1966). Among other things, this proposed that effective 30 June a new payment schedule be established. and that payments to trustees be discontinued entirely.

3. I told Gratz and Millian that while the reference sought our opinion regarding the proposed action, the matter of payments to dependents was political rather than legal. In this connection. I referred to such memoranda as Bissell's of 8 May 1961 and Helms' of 31 December 1962, which indicate that the White House had determined that these payments would be made. In response to the prepresentation that the search of WH/C files failed to reflect any policy guidance subsequent to that set out in the DDP's memorandum of 31 December, I suggested that the Wave proposal be discussed with Mr. Sam Halpern, who had previously served as Executive Officer, TFW

4. During the afternoon of 11 August, Millian and I met with Halpern. He stated that the White House was aware that payments to

dependents were being continued He also took issue with allegation
regarding the lack of policy *guidanc*, saying that it was set out in the
YOBITE messages to Wave. copies of which could be found in WH/C
files. It was his view that the White House would not want to risk.
the charge of bad faith, even if the Government might ultimately
realize a saving of some quarter of a million dollars a year. He took
the position that if WH/C wished to raise the matter for the DCI's
present consideration, it should first familiarize itself with YOBITE
traffic. Halpern agreed with me that this subject was not one for con-
sideration by the 30.3 Committee. We concluded with a suggestion that
Chief, WH/C might wish to discuss that matter with Chief. WH/D
before proceeding further.

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel

SUBJECT: Payments to Dependents of
Brigade 2506 Members

1. Attached hereto is a copy of a memorandum containing recommendations for phasing out payments to dependents of Brigade 2506 members. WH/Cuba plans to propose phasing out and terminating these payments but, before doing so, a review of the legal factors by the office of the General Counsel is desired. It is requested that an estimate be given of possible residual U.S. Government liability in these cases, and advice as to whether they can be handled on the basis of one-time termination payments.

2. In addition to the above, WH/Cuba would appreciate any advice or suggestions on methods or procedures which might be used in effecting the terminations.

3. A reply from your office would be appreciated on or before 10 August 1966.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/Cuba

SUBJECT: Recommendations Concerning Payments to Dependents of Brigade Members

1. A review of the existing files fails to reveal any evidence of a clear-cut policy concerning the duration of payments to dependents of Brigade members killed, captured or missing in action despite the many recommendations made at various times to resolve this problem. This lack of policy is implicit in a memorandum from Mr. Helms to the DDCI dated 23 May 1962 in which he referred to a Presidential oral directive that payments to dependents were to be continued until termination by Presidential order. A later memorandum from Mr. Helms to the DDCI, dated 31 December 1962, contained recommendations for terminating these monthly payments with a lump sum death payment to be made to dependents of those killed or missing in action. Both memoranda are attached for your review.. A memorandum from Mr. Sterling Cottrell to the Attorney General, dated 1 February 1963, concerning various agreements reached between Brigade leaders, AMBUD and the Agency, also included three possible alternatives for resolving the problem of dependency payments as follows:

A. Follow regulations established by the Bureau of Employment Compensation, 1.e. $1,000 lump sum payment for loss of life.

B. Follow U.S. Army practice, 1.e. monthly payments of $122 or more (depending on rank and length of service) for as long as the widow survives and does not re-marry. This, Mr. Cottrell pointed out, would be a costly program to administer and would cost roughly $300,000 a year for an indefinite period. (This has proven to be true).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

C. A lump sum arbitrary payment of $3,000 which would be a year's dependency at the highest rate (250 per month).

2. Obviously, the above recommendations as well as others proposed at various timos in an effort to terminate this costly exercise were never acted on and due to the timo lag are probably no longer practical. Tentative approaches to the problem were also made by exploring the possibility of working out some mechanism by which HEW could take over disbursements at a reduced rate and periodic rulings and guidance were requested from the General Counsel concerning the legal and security factors inherent in the proposals.

3. When the original cover mechanism was established for disbursing these payments, the dependents were apparently advised that such payments would continue as long as funds were available. In view of the indefinite time stipula- tion together with the long-standing demise of the AMBUD organization and its relationship to this program, dependents could reasonably be expected to philosophically accept the fact that these funds have finally been exhausted. In the light of similar past experiencos, some carping and pro- tests from dissident's can be anticipated with the usual security hazards whenever the decision is made to terminate this project. These possibilities can hardly justify the indefinite continuation of this enormous expenditure of funds which to date amounts to approximately $2,000,000.00. Any question that may arise as to who has really been foot- ing this bill is unlikely to cause any shock to the public at large after being deluged with reams of Cuban postmortems.

4. The review and recommendations forwarded by JMWAVE are comprehensive and appear to be more than generous in the approach toward a two-stage cut-off of payments. I do believe the recommendations to immediately cease any further payments to trustees should be submitted to the General Counsel for a ruling on the legal technicalities involved in such a step. This may also apply to any attempt to remove existing funds from trustees who are con- sidered to be unreliable or even dishonest in the administra- tion of funds under this control. These trustees were specifically designated by Brigade members and the written authorization to support such trusteeships are in the custody of AMTIKI. It would seem that no one but the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 148

principal himself or his heirs has the legal right to revoke a trusteeship even in the mishandling of funds. Based on a review of pertinent documents and a discussion with Mrs. Evie Vidal, who is probably more knowledgeable of the facts and nuances of this problem than anyone else, I have listed bolow some recommendations for your consideration:

A. In line with recent JMWAVE recommendations, payments to all principal dependents (wives who have not remarried) be reduced by 30 July, or as soon as feasible, to a flat $100 por month and all minor dependents reduced to $25 per month with notification that all payments will cease 6 months from date of initial reduction. All secondary dependents, such as dependent parents who receive separate chocks of not more than $50 por month, should be continuod at the present rate until the final termination date for all dependents.

B. Such adjustments as recommended above should bo uniform and across the board with no attempt to evaluate each case on an individual basis determined by such factors as outside income, need, etc. This would not only tend to create an undesirable security hazard but would complicate the phasing out of an already complicated situation. Furthermore, individuals who have made an effort to raise their standard of living by augmentation of their income would be justified in feeling they wore penalized for having more ambition than some of the lazy pensioner types. Once we attempt to play the role of Solomon as to who is the most worthy or the most needy, we lose sight of the fact that all dependents are equal as widows whose husbands died for the same cause and we could expect no end of recriminations. Neither should there be any distinction as is recommended in some instances by JMWAVE that payments should cease because dependents happen to reside in Cuba. They are as entitled to the same benefits as those fortunate enough to reside in this country. The exception to this may be justified in those isolated cases where it is evident that nothing has been heard from such dependents and they have never received any benefits from the money paid for their support. In these instances payments to trustees should probably be terminated immediately if such action is legal.

C. In the case of the known prisoners, two courses of action could be pursued. Either cut the present dependency payments in line with that proposed for dependents


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 149

-4-

of deceased with the understanding such payments will con-
tinue until the status of each man is resolved (cither by
release or death while in prison) or leave the present
amount being paid unchanged with indefinite continuation.
Considering the few involved (16 according to the JMWAVE
study), the last proposal would probably bo botter from a
psychological point of view and remove any possibility of
charges against us of endangering the lives of the prisoners.
Furthermore, the memorandum from Mr. Cottrell to the
Attorney General referred to in paragraph 1 included as
part of the general agreement reached with Brigade leaders
assurance that payments to dependents of Brigade members
remaining in prison would be continued. Ono caso that
falls in this category is extremely interesting. It
concerns case #13 who is imprisoned under an alias and in
order to insure his safety there seems to be a tacit agree-
mont to treat him as dead. It may be quite a feat to
avoid a charge of discrimination against his wife if her
payments are terminated "as a widow" in order to preserve
the "deceased" cover to preserve his safety.

D. Prior to submitting recommendations to the
303 Committee for phasing out dependency paymonts, a ruling
on all the legal and possible security aspects of any
proposal should probably be obtained from the General Counsel.

5. I have not explored in depth the background of
   the benefits presently being paid to the dependents of
   Heroes/Martyrs, the majority of which do not appear to
   have been Brigade members and do not come under the same
   criteria established for Brigade members. In the event
   you aro contemplating torminating this type of payments,
   such action could no doubt be defended as not boing ap-
   plicable to the conditions governing dependents of Brigade
   mombers. It has been my understanding that your proposal
   to submit a memorandum to the 303 Committee in the immediate
   future concerns only recommendations for resolving the
   Brigade dependency payments. If I am incorrect and such
   memorandum is to also cover the continued payments to
   Heroes/Martyrs dependents, please advise me as to what you
   wish done.

3. AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF VARIOUS FACTORS INVOLVED
   STATION DECIDED IT PREFERABLE FOR STATION TO MAKE FINAL JUDGMENT
   AND THAT IT NOT NECESSARY TO SEEK ASSESSMENT FROM SOCIAL WORKER,
   ESPECIALLY SINCE DATA ON FORMS IN MOST CASE /IN SOME INSTANCES
   RECIPIENT REFUSED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS/-IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE
   FOUITABILE JUDGMENT TO BE MAUE. TOU SOCIAL WORKERS WERE NOT AVAILABLE
   BECAUSE OF CUBAN AIRLIFT REQUIREMENTS.

4. ANALYSIS OF DATA COLLECTED INDICATED ADVISABILITY OF
   ESTABLISHING CRITERIA GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL CATEGORIES OF
   BENEFICIARIES, THEN MAKING EXCEPTIONS ONLY IN CASES WHERE GENUINE
   HUMANITARIAN OR HARDSHIP FACTORS EXIST. SURVEY REVEALED, AS ANTI-
   CIPATED, THAT NUMBER OF DEPENDENTS, HAVE MADE STRONG EFFORT TO
   PREPARE SELVES FOR DATE WHEN BENEFIT PAYMENTS WOULD CEASE, WHILE
   OTHERS HAVE EXPENDED FUNDS ON LUXURIES, HAVE MADE LITTLE OR NO
   ATTEMPT TO BECOME ECONOMICALLY SELF SUFFICIENT, AND APPEAR TO
   CONSIDER SELVES AS INDEFINITE PENSIONERS OF ODYOKE /DESPITE IDEN A
   COVER IT CLEAR MOST RECIPIENTS CONSIDER THEY RECEIVING BENEFIT FROM
   ODYOKE/

5. JMWAVE RECOMMENDS FOLLOWING ACTION.

A. THAT BENEFIT PAYMENTS BE CONTINUED AT THE PRESENT RATE
UNTIL 30 JUNE 1966.

B. THAT EFFECTIVE 1 JULY 1966 A NEW SCHEDULE OF BENEFIT
PAYMENTS BE ESTABLISHED. JMWAVE RECOMMENDS THAT THIS SCHEDULE
COMPRISE /1/ $100 PER MONTH FOR THE FIRST DEPENDENT, /2/ $25 PER
MONTH FOR EACH ADDITIONAL DEPENDENT..

C. THAT EFFECTIVE 1 JULY 1966 ALL PAYMENTS TO TRUSTEES..

D. THAT ON THE BASIS OF THE DATA CONTAINED IN THE CURRENT
SURVEY ACTION BE INITIATED /BY AMTIKI I PRIMARILY THRU LETTER
CONTACT/ TO ATTEMPT TO RETRIEVE THE FUNDS ALLEGEDLY HELD IN CERTAIN
TRUSTEE ACCOUNTS OR BY CERTAIN TRUSTEES. IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE
TRUSTEE HAS DEMONSTRATED HONESTY AND CORRECT DEALING IN THE MAIN-
TENANCE OF A TRUSTEE ACCOUNT WITH A REPUTABLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION
THE CURRENT ACCOUNT WOULD BE LEFT IN PRESENT DEPOSITORY. HOWEVER,
PER PARA 5 C ABOVE NO ADDITONAL FUNDS WOULD BE PAID TO TRUSTEE FOR
DEPOSIT.

E. THAT A TERMINAL DATE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ALL BENEFITS
BE FIXED. JMWAVE RECOMMENDS THAT THIS DATE BE EITHER /1/ 30 DECEMBER
1966, OR/2/30 JUNE 1967.

6. IF ABOVE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE APPROVED, STATION PLANS
   FOLLOWING ENABLING ACTION. ITEMS KEYED TO PARA 5 ABOVE.

A,B - STATION, THRU REGISTERED LETTER FROM IDEN A, WOULD
NOTIFY EACH RECIPIENT OF NEW PAYMENT SCALE PRIOR TO 30 JUNE 1966.

C,D - STATION, THRU REGISTERED LETTER FROM IDEN A, WOULD
NOTIFY EACH TRUSTEE THAT PAYMENTS TO TRUSTEES END 30 JUNE 1966.
IN CASE OF THOSE TRUSTEES CONSIDERED ''UNRELIABLE LETTER WOULD
ALSO REQUEST RETURN OF FUNDS TO IDEN A TO HOLD FOR BENEFICIARY.

E. IF TERMINATION DATE SET AT 30 DECEMBER 1966, ALL
RECIPIENTS WOULD BE NOTIFIEBY REGISTERED LETTER PRIOR TO 1 AUGUST
1966. IF DATE SET AT 30 JUNE 1967, ALL RECIPIENTS WOULD BE NOTIFIED
BY LETTER PRIOR TO 30 DECEMBER 1966.

7. IT CLEAR THAT EXECUTION OF ACTIONS IN PARAS 5 AND 6 ABOVE.
   WILL ELICIT SOME COMPLAINTS, ESPECIALLY FROM THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO
   HAVE TAKEN NO ACTION TO RENDER SELVES SELF-SUFFICIENT AND FROM THOSE
   TRUSTEES WHO HAVE MISAPPROPRIATED FUNDS WHICH THEY SUPPOSED TO HOLD
   IN CUSTODY. HOWEVER BELIEVE THAT SOLUTIONS PROPOSED ARE EMINENTLY
   FAIR AND COULD BE EASILY JUSTIFIED TO ANY UNBIASED PARTY WITHIN

OR OUTSIDE OF ODYOKE. AMBUD PROGRAM HAS EXPENDED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
AND BENEFITS PROVIDED TO BENEFICIARIES IN MANY CASES HAVE FAR EXCEEDED
THOSE PROVIDED BY ODYOKE TO ITS OWN EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED
OR SUFFERED INJURIES IN LINE OF DUTY.

8. SINCE STATION NOT AWARE OF ALL INTERAGENCY BACKGROUND RE
   RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PAYMENT OF BENEFITS IN CASE OF CAPTURED OR
   MISSING PERSONNEL, STATION CAN NOT SUGGEST EXACT METHOD OF HANDLING
   FUTURE EARMARKING OF FUNDS, IF ANY, FOR THESE PERSONNEL. HOWEVER,
   STATION TENDS ESTABLISHMENT OF PROCEDURE SIMILARSYO THAT EMPLOYED
   FOR CERTAIN CAPTURED AGENTS, I.E., ESTABLISHMENT OF "CAPTIVITY PAY"
   SCALE AND POST-RETURN NEGOTIATION RE AMOUNT TO BE PAID.

9. STATION REQUESTS SOONEST CONSIDERATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS
   CITED PARA 5 AND 6 ABOVE, NOTABLY A THRU D - DECISION RE E
   /TERMINATION DATE/ CAN BE MADE LATER. APPEARS THAT DECISION RE
   ACTIONS A AND B MAY HAVE TO BE REFERRED TO HIGHER AUTHORITY AND
   THAT IMPLEMENTATION DATE MAY HAVE TO BE POSTPONED. HOWEVER, WOULD
   APPEAR THAT KUBARK CAN TAKE ACTIONS C AND D AT OWN DISCRETION. THUS
   REQUEST HQS APPROVAL SOONEST RE ACTIONS C AND D. ADVISE.

10. FYI AT PRESENT AMTIKI 1 IS TRUSTEE FOR SOME CASES AND HAS
    BEEN MAKING MONTHLY DEPOSITS TO THESE ACCOUNTS. STATION RECOMMENDS
    THAT FUNDS IN THESE ACCOUNTS BE ALLOWED REMAIN ON DEPOSIT /HOWEVER
    NO FURTHER DEPOSITS WOULD BE MADE, PER SUGGESTED ACTION D ABOVE/.
    HOWEVER STATION PLANS WITHDRAW AMTIKI 1'S CUSTODIAL POWERS WITH
    RESPECT TO THESE ACCOUNTS, TRANSFERRING THEM TO CHIEF OF FINANCE
    BRANCH, AND AS ALTERNATE, DEPUTY CHIEF OF FINANCE BRANCH.

11. FYI VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM FOR WOUNDED MEMBERS
    OF BRIGADE CONTINUES. BASIC TERMINATION DATE NOW SET FOR 30 JUNE
1966. PLAN CONTINUE BENEFITS IN FEW DIFFICULT MEDICAL CASES. CAN
      NOT ESTIMATE TERMINATION DATE FOR THESE CASES.

12. FORWARDED AS ATTACHMENT 2 IS CONSOLIDATED DATA CONCERNING
    ACTUAL COSTS OF AMBUD IN FY 66 AND PROPOSED EXPENDITURES IN FY 67.
