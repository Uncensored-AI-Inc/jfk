MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Retirement - Tennent H. Bagley

1. The retirement of Subject, effected as a result of a memorandum from the Head of his Career Service stating that he is surplus to the needs of the Service and that his retirement will be recommended to the Director under the provisions of the CIA Retirement and Disability System pertaining to involuntary retirement, in no way implies an adverse action. Subject signed an application for retirement of his own volition in order to qualify for an immediate retirement annuity. The liberalized criteria for such separations was established by the Agency to parallel similar actions under the Civil Service Retirement System in accordance with FPM Letter No. 831-23, dated 10 December 1969.

2. Any inquiry received concerning the nature of the separation of Subject from the Agency should be confirmed simply as a retirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Tennent H. Bagley

SUBJECT : Involuntary Retirement Under the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1.  This will confirm a previous discussion with you concerning the problem of a surplus in your career service of on-duty strength in relation to new reduced ceiling and the consequent need to effect a reduction in personnel. At that time you indicated your willingness to assist your career service in reaching its roduced personnel.ceiling by accepting involuntary retirement.

2.  Accordingly, and in order to establish the necessary conditions for involuntary retirement under CIARDS, I have determined that you are surplus to the needs of your career service and will recommend your retirement to the Director, effective 30 June 1972.

3.  I urge you to contact the Retirement Affairs Division, Office of Personnel, where every effort will be made to provide whatever information and assistance you may need in preparing for your proposed retirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Board

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to GS-17 -
Mr. Tennant H. Bagley

1. It is recommended that Mr. Tennent H. Bagley be pro- moted to GS-17. He has been in grade as GS-16 since June 1965 and has served as COS in Brussels since August 1967. His previous assignment was as Deputy Chief, SB Division.

2. The reasons for this promotion are amply covered in my fitness report of this same date. I have just returned from an extensive trip through the European area, during which I had a chance to see and talk with a very large number of officers under both official and non-official cover. Pete Bagley is one of two whom I am recommending for promotion as a result. He is one of our very finest station chiefs, possessed of imagination, intellect and ability personally to handle operations which very few of his colleagues can match. He is one of those on whom the future of the Organization is going to depend, and I believe that the promotion is more than justified.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Robert W. Sheay
Secretary
Clandestine Services
Career Service Board

SUBJECT: Mr. Tennent H. Bagley
Promotion to GS-17

1. Mr. Bagley was promoted to GS-16 on 6 June 1965. At that time he was Chief, CI Group, SR Division. On 1 September 1965 he was appointed Deputy Division Chief, SR Division. As his fitness reports attest, his performance in that position was outstanding and when in May 1966 the Soviet Bloc Division was created he was named Deputy Division Chief of the new Division.

2. Thore is little that need be added to previous fitness reports in my evaluation of Mr. Bagley's current performance. It continues to be that of a dedicated and gifted officer whose energies and extensive substantive knowledge make a vital contribution to one of the top priority programs of the Clandestine Services. Much more important, in considering Mr. Bagley for promotion to the next level of the supergrades, is his potential for additional growth and responsibility. He would be capable now of taking charge of a field station, particularly one with special opportunities for work against the Soviet Bloc and the Chinese targets. With time (he is forty-one) he will bé capable of assuming the senior position in any division or staff in the CS. He is clearly one of the outstanding officers in our service.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Mr. Robert W. Sheay
Secretary
Clandestine Services
Carcer Service Board

SUBJECT: Tennent H. Bagley
Promotion to GS-16

1. Mr. Bagley is without question among the best qualified of the senior officers in SR Division and is also one of the most competent counterespionage officers in the Clandestine Services as a whole. Few have had his prep- aration or his experience in the Soviet Bloc aspects of this field. After entering on duty in 1950 he was assigned to the Vienna Station where for five years he worked directly on operations against the Soviet intelligence elements con- centrated there. When he returned to Headquarters, he supervised thẻ CE Section of the Polish Branch, EE Division when a combination of defectors and penetrations of the Polish services made this job one of the most demanding of any in the Clandestine Services. In his next overseas assignment in Switzerland, he evolved techniques of opera- tional analysis of Soviet intelligence residencies which form the backbone of the system we are using today. While in this post he participated in an operation involving a major penetration of the Polish intelligence service which also had enormous significance for our efforts against the Soviets. Just prior to his departure from Switzerland, he handled one of the most complex and challenging Soviet CE operations ever encountered by our service.

2. In 1962 he was appointed Chief of SR Division's CE element. Under his direction the CE effort of the Division took on entirely new dimensions. Because of Mr. Bagley's marvelous, combination of CS experience, substantive knowledge and enthusiasm, the SR/CI Group has become one of the most effective and highly motivated units in the Division. The Group has developed a high level of sub- stantive specialization which it applies to CS coverage of the Soviet intelligence services throughout the world. At the same time, a large percentage of the Group's best officers have been committed full time to a special opera- tion of great value and significance. The ability of

SR/CI to absorb this workload stems not only from Mr. Bagley's capacity for professional guidance but his effectiveness in leading and inspiring those under him.

3. Mr. Bagley's record to date reveals a high degree of specialization in counterespionage yet it would be misleading indeed to conclude that his professional interests and potential are confined to this field. His contributions to the broader problems of Soviet operations have been invaluable particularly in the way in which he has suggested new techniques for attacking the Soviet target abroad.

4. I consider Mr. Bagley an outstanding officer to whom the Clandestine Services will turn for the exercise of still greater responsibilities in the future. He is fully qualified for promotion to GS-16. I urge that he be promoted now in recognition of the work he has done so far and the potential he possesses for a productive career at the top level of Clandestine Services officers.

I wish to express my appreciation for your participation in our training program at Warrenton from 23-27 September 1963.

CLASSIFICATION

TO: Chief, FE DATE: 12 May 1954
Attn: Kenneth K. Wilbanks
FROM: Chief of Mission, Austria
SUBJECT: GENERAL - Administrative
SPECIFIC - Recommendation for Promotion -

1. Subject joined KUBARK in July 1950. He was given the Staff Orientation, and the Basic and Advanced Operations courses prior to his arrival at VOB in June 1951. After a period of agent handling and technical work in the operations support field, Subject was made Chief of the Counter Espionage Section for the Mission in November 1952, a position which he has held until his very recent reassignment to the Soviet Section. Following Home Leave, he began his second tour here in September 1953. Subject joined the Mission as a OS-9, was promoted to OS-11 on 26 April 1953.

2. Subject was given a rather long apprenticeship in Vienna before he was called upon to set up the CE Section. During this orientation period he was exposed to a variety of intelligence problems, including technical surveillance, photography, secret writing, and documentation, the handling of two American deep cover agents, the training and mounting of an Hungarian border crosser, and the direction of an Austrian double agent. As Chief of the Counter Espionage Section, Subject's responsibilities included the supervision and training of its personnel, the direction and coordination of its activities, and the setting up of procedures for namechecking, carding, file research, and the maintenance of CE and central personality files. Subject was personally responsible for CE analysis as directed by the Chief of Operations. Subject's activity has been restricted to the Soviet CE picture, which we consider a major operational effort of this Mission.

3. Subject's interest and enthusiasm in his work, his attention to duty, and his ability to obtain results have been outstanding attributes in his performance here, and have resulted in his becoming thoroughly familiar with the CE problem in Austria. He has done exceptionally well on a variety of operations, giving each of his cases a maximum amount of planning, and demonstrating an unusual grasp for details. He has read widely in case files, and now possesses a better than average counter-intelligence background. Subject has a good working knowledge of German, which he has learned from scratch here, and has built up a remarkable knowledge of this area. He was quick to learn the techniques of basic tradecraft, which had enabled him to teach junior case officers and to instruct in the trade-craft seminars held at VOB. His staff guidance in certain double agent cases has increased considerably their value to this Mission. Written reports turned in by Subject have been excellent, displaying forcefulness, fluency, and lucidity, as well as the essential brevity. He has a forceful personality and is unusually successful in agent handling.

4. A mature appearance,

4. A mature appearance, an especially mature manner, and an excellent social presence have enabled Subject to move freely in the local scene. We consider him an extremely valuable senior case officer, and recommended unanimously that he be promoted to OS-12 at a recent meeting of the Promotion Board.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

The request of Tennent Harrington Bagley for permission to remain employed by this Agency after marriage is approved subject to the followings:

1. Subject's immediate supervisor will be notified by cable to counsel with subject regarding the serious effect the marriage will have in impairing what otherwise appears to be an outstanding career with this Agency. Subject, although young, has demonstrated exceptional ability and great promise and has been promoted well ahead of others of his age bracket. Based upon his actions to date, it would appear subject might ultimately expect to attain a position of considerable importance and responsibility in this Agency, if no inherent limitations develop. The proposed marriage places such a limitation on the use of subject, not only in particular parts of Europe, but in Headquarters as well. Certain clearances required of high level employees of the Agency will be difficult to obtain if this marriage is contracted, and the limitations on the type of assignments which will be available to him will not enhance his career development.

2. After receiving this counsel and giving it consideration, if subject continues in his desire to marry and contracts the marriage, he will be removed from Austria as soon as he can conveniently arrange for his spouse's visa. Following the marriage, he shall be withdrawn from the more sensitive elements of the Station's business.

SUBTACT: BAGLEY, Junetts A. (P363), Area Operations Officer, OS-13, SS Division, Request for Permission to remain in the employ of the Agency After marriage to an Alien

1. It is recommended that Mr. Bagley's request to remain in the employ of the Agency after his marriage to Maria Leyer, an Austrian citizen, be approved.

2. This recommendation is based on the following factors after consideration of this request by the Clandestine Services Career Service panels:

a. Mr. Bagley has served effectively with the Agency since July 1959, He has demonstrated unusual ability in his field assignments and is regarded as an extremely valuable career officer.

b. The limitation which this proposed marriage would place on Mr. Bagley's use in his current assignment would be minimal since his normal tour of duty in Austria will expire in September of this year.

3. The security aspects of this proposed marriage have been deferred to the office of security for its separate recommendation.

TRNMENT H. BAGLEY

Recommendation for Promotion-

1. Subject joined KULARK in July 1950. He was given the Staff Orientation, and the Basic and Advanced Operations courses prior to his arrival at FOB in June 1951. After a period of agent handling and technical work in the operations support field, Subject was made Chief of the Counter Fspionage Section for the Mission in November 1952, a position which he has hold until his very recent reassignment to the Boviet section. Following Home Leave, he began his second tour here in September 1953. Subject joined the Mission as a 08-9, was promoted to C-11 on 26 April 1953.

2. Subject was given a rather long apprenticeship in Vienna before he was called upon to set up the CE Section. During this orientation period he was exposed to a variety of intelligence problems, including technical surveillance, photography, secret writing, and documentation, the handling of two American deep cover agents, the training and mounting. of an hungarian border crosser, and the direction of an Austrian double agent. As Chiof of the Counter Espionago Section, Subject's responsibilities included the supervision end training of its personnel, the direction and coordination of its activities, and the setting up of procedures for namechecking, carding, file research, and the maintenance of CE and central personality files. Subject was personally responsible for CE analysis as directed by the Chief of Operations. Subject's activity has been restricted to the Soviet CF picture, which we consider a major operational effort of this Mission.

3. Subject's interest and enthusiasm in his work, his attention to auty, and his ability to obtain resulta have been cutstanding attributes in his performance here, and have resulted in his becaning thoroughly familiar with the CE promow in Austria. He has done exceptionally welz ann varicty or operations, operat mint of planning, and demonstrating an unusual grasp for details. He has read widely in case files, and now possesses a better than average counter-intelligence background. Subject has a good working knowledge of German, which ho has learned from scratch here, and he has built in a remarkable Inowledge of this area. He was quick to learn the techniques of basic tradecraft, which had enabled him to teach juntor cañe officers and to instruct in the trade-craft seminars held at VOB. His staff guidance in certeto double agont cases has increased considerably their value to this Mission. Written roports turned in by Subject have been excellent, displaying forgefulness, fluency, and lucidity, as well as the casential brevity. He has a forceful personality and la umusually successful in agent handling.

4. A mature appearance,

1. joined KUBARK in July 1950 and arrived at this
   Mission on the 15th of June 1951 as a 08-9.

2. Since his arrival has continually showed himself as a
   great asset to the Mission. After a period of technical work and agent handling,
   was made chief of the Counter Espionage Section for the Mission in November
1952. He has done an excellent job in organizing this section and in handling

FROM:
FIH

SUBJECT: Tennent H. Bagley.

Mr. Bagley has been recalled to active duty as a First Lieutenant in the Marine Corps with effective date 11 December 1950. The order is by letter MC-1243761 of Headquarters U. S. Marine Corps, Washington, D. C., dated 3 November 1950 and addressed to his home in La Jolla, California (copy attached). Since Mr. Bagley is on duty in Washington, he did not receive the order until 13 November 1950.

Mr. Bagley was employed by this Agency on 24 July 1950 as a Research Analyst assigned to the Advisory Council. Since reporting for duty, he has been in the Training Courses and will complete the Advanced Operations Course on 1 December 1950. During this period, however, it has been agreed that his qualifications could best be utilized as an Intelligence Officer in Germany, and the papers are now in requesting his transfer to FIH for that purpose.

Request that Mr. Bagley's deferment from recall to active duty with the Marine Corps be arranged on the grounds that his work in the Training Courses has shown him to be unusually well qualified for intelligence work in Germany and that men of his caliber and background are still badly needed by the German Station. If this deferment can be arranged, he will be sent to Germany as a GS-9 Intelligence Officer at the earliest opportunity.

Mr. Tennent H. Bagley, currently Chief of Station, Brussels, is recommended for the Intelligence Medal of Merit in recognition of his outstanding service of 22 years as a Clandestine Services officer.

For personal reasons Mr. Bagley has elected to retire effective June 1972.

From the beginning of his CS career, Mr. Bagley's exceptional abilities were clearly recognized and he received assignments of ever increasing responsibility in the Soviet operations field. Following a highly successful tour as a senior operations officer in Switzerland, Mr. Bagley was assigned to Headquarters as Chief of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the SR Division. In this key and demanding post, Mr. Bagley showed managerial skill combined with knowledge in depth of the complexities of counter intelligence work. His outstanding performance resulted in his promotion to GS-16 in June 1965 and his subsequent appointment as Deputy Chief of SR Division in September 1965 the comparatively young age of 39.

In addition to the full duties as Deputy Chief of an active division, Mr. Bagley continued to carry heavy responsibilities throughout this period in the field of counter intelligence. He was one of

the key officers responsible for the direction and control of some of the most sensitive operations then boing conducted by the Clandestine Services. He carried out his responsibilities with skill and discretion, and the ability to stand up under repeated periods of heavy pressure.

In recognition of his excellent service as Deputy Chief SR, Mr. Bagley in March 1967 was assigned as Chief of Station, Brussels, a major target area of Soviet ospionage due to the presence of NATO and European Community Headquarters.

In the past five years as Chief of Station, Brussels, Mr. Bagley has been an effective Station, Chief who has been particularly successful in the field of liaison. He established a unique relationship with the Chief of the Belgian Internal Security Service which has greatly facilli- tated the over-all operational activities of the Brussels Station. This relationship successfully underwent its strongest test at the time of the defection of a GRU officer in Brussels in October 1971 and the subsequent worldwide propaganda exploitation of his disclosures.

Under Mr. Bagley's direction Brussels Station has concentrated heavily on the Soviet target and has been a major test area for the non-official cover concept for operations.

Mr. Bagley's entire career has been characterized by the consistent excellence of his performance in each assign- ment of increasing responsibilities that he has undertaken. He is recognized as one of the top Soviot operations specialists in the Clandestine Service and has spent the bulk of his twenty-two year career working in the most sensitive and complex areas of intolligonce work. Wo regret his decision to retire for personal reasons and the loss of his experience and expertise to the Clandestine Service. It is strongly recommended that in recognition of his outstanding service to the Clandestine Service in positions of critical and demanding responsibility Mr. Tennont H. Bagley be awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Tennent H. Bagley, GS-16, Employee
Number 056043, DOB: 11 November
1925; Chief of Station; Career;
Service Designation: D.

PERIOD UNDER REVIEW: 1 April 1970 - 31 March 1971

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 42 months

OVER-ALL RATING: Strong

1.  As Mr. Bagley completes approximately 42 months as Chief of Station, Brussels, progress in Brussels remains uneven. An aggressive attack against the Soviet target has been undertaken by a portion of the Station. Liaison has been exploited to a degree unparalleled in other European Stations. However, there has been a rather frustrating lack of major progress on the part of the NOC component of the Station, While a number of factors have contributed to these results, Mr. Bagley's style of leadership has undoubtedly been a major one..

2.  Mr. Bagley has few peers in his ability to investigate and define a Soviet target, and to design mechanisms capable of assaulting this target. The research of this target under his close supervision has been impressive, and the mechanisms designed to support contemplated operations and to keep the target under constant review have been functionally designed. Some impressive achievements have resulted from these efforts but, at the same time, overall progress has been disappointing:

A. The non-official cover component of Brussels Station, consisting of 10 operations officers,
2 support officers and 4 other personnel, is only now taking a 'form which would permit its effective deployment, but its gains, in organizational readiness are threatened by the possible loss of leadership which, in turn, stems at least in part from failure of Mr. Bagley clearly to delegate both responsibility and authority to the key individuals involved in this unit.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 124

-2-

B. The physical divisions within the official component of the Station have separated personnel and files in a manner which makes close teamwork against the target difficult. These divisions could and should have been corrected.

C. Mr. Bagley has not always seen eye-to-eye with Headquarters on matters of method and emphasis, a phenomenon which has impaired operational progress. We accept that each Station Chief has the right -- indeed, the duty -- to hold independent views and to express them with integrity (as Mr. Bagley has done), but believe that differing views could have been resolved more easily had Station reporting to Headquarters been less parsimonious.

3. To sum up, Mr. Bagley's abilities to conceptualize and to build viable models is truly outstanding, as is the exhaustively thorough manner of his staff work; his capability to translate his concepts into productive human endeavor has been less Impressive. In spite of his considorable social and diplomatic skills, Mr. Bagley is essentially a reserved person who finds some difficulty in communicating with his subordinates.

4. In spite of the problems noted, problems which we perhaps overstress as a result of our high expectations, Brussels Station has made good progress during/this period and Mr. Bagley's performance has been STRONG.

COMMENTS on Fitness Report on Tennent H. Bagley
1 April 1970 - 31 March 1971

I agree with the fitness report's own suggestion that the "problems" it noted were overstressed: its negative contont outweighs the positive by nearly three to one and is omphasized by its format and sentence structure. Because its overall effect belies the "Strong" rating, I believe that it creates a misleading picture, and therefore think it necessary to comment. Moreover, the report leaves the impression of a goneral failing in two specific areas which I am sure it did not intend to, since these are two areas which, during the two years since the preceding fitness report, have been repeatedly praised by Division management: 1) the level of operational activity at this Station ("his capability to translate his concepts into productive human ondeavor has been loss impressive") and 2) the development of a NOC facility ("frustrating lack of major progress on the part of the NOC component").

The report could usefully have made more precise its implication that I have not created a satisfactory amount of productive human endeavor by my concepts and plans. When I took over this Station I inherited about 10 valid unilateral assots. We have since added at least 80 new ones, of whom about 10 romain particularly productive and promising and at least 25 more continue to bo useful, sometimes Decessary, informants or action types. Most if not all of these new assets were spotted and recruited in direct response to my planning and concepts. I have thus more than quintupled the Station's assets and its capability to respond to the varied directivos and requests it receives. The high rate of acquisition of new assets has remained generally constant throughout the period since the preceding fitness report.. Perhaps the current fitness report questions the "productivity" of these assets; this is of course debatable, but can be properly judged only in terms of our designated objectives. We were directed to establish contact with Soviets and assess them, with a view to their eventual recruitment. When I took over, this Station had access of one sort or another to perhaps four Soviet officials; we have built to the point where we now have contact and are providing assessments through unilateral assets alone on nearly 40 Soviets currently here (more, I would suspect, than any other station in the world) not to mention some 20 other Soviets covered by liaison

operations at least partly stimulated by us, and not counting the many who have left PCS during this period. Going beyond assessment, we have taken concrete steps toward recruitment of a number of Soviet and Bloc officials (offers, hints, pressures, etc., directed through our assets), we have řecruited several employees of Soviet installations in Brussels and Antwerp, and we have made at least one significant Bloc recruitment.

The assessments provided by our numerous assets on 2. large proportion of the local Soviets have permitted us to find and to focus more realistically (i.e., with some degree of hope) on the few promising targets. We have so focussed, although, as the report says, in this there have been differences with Headquarters on method and emphasis. But these differences were largely a matter of semantics, and they have not impaired operational progress: I cannot think, nor have been told at any time, of a single specific thing left undone against any target Soviet because of the Station's method and emphasis.

In addition to our steady progress in the Soviet field,. we have so built up our local capabilities that we can and do respond (to what I am told is an unusual degree) to requests of other components of the CS, and in doing so we are using largely agents recruited during my tenure and according to my plans. We provide and backstop cover for FE operations in the Far East; we recruit participants for LCPIPIT organizations; we provide live addresses for other divisions' operations; we actively support, by action and propaganda, worldwide psych programs; we send agents, some- times in response to book-cable requests, to fulfill organization missions in (for example) Biafra, Saigon, the South Sudan, Paris and Tokyo; we recruit support agents for the use of other stations in their areas; we we handle agents in other areas on behalf of other stations; we use our assets to spot and introduce people useful for other stations. We do this without diminishing the rate of acquisition of new assets directed at our primary objectives. This human endeavor does not seem unproductive.

The second general area in which the fitness report leaves the Impression of general inadequacy concerns our NOC activity. The NOC structure I created (and whose strengths,

like the shortcomings referred to in the report, are due
largely to my "style") has repeatedly been called an
innovative ground-breaking experiment. During the past year
the Division has sent COS's and officers from other stations
to Brussels to study and, presumably, to emulate applicable
parts of it. This structure was created since the preceding
fitness report, but the present one mentions only a "lack of
progress" (which is moreover not defined and is not clear
even to me: What is "progress on the part of a NOC component"?)
If progress or lack of it is represented by the number of
cases turned over to NOC handling, then it is worth noting
that this Station works on the principle, not accepted every-
where, that all cases will be handled by NOC officers unless
there are overriding reasons to the contrary. So far we have
turned over some 35, another 15 turnovers are imminent, and
others are delayed only because turnover to NOC now would be
premature and potentially damaging. Since we have had to spot
and recruit overy source which could be turned over to NOC
handling, it might be forgiven that we have not yet provided
full case loads to ten active NOC officers, most of whom
arrived at about the same timo a year and a half ago. We
are trying hard to produce now sources, while at the same time
reducing the excessive number of NOC officers. If "lack of
progress" monns that our experimentation with different modes
of communication, command, and administration of NOC units
has not yot developed a final form or doctrine, the comment
is valid, but our very activo experimentation continues to
identify false avenues as well as to revcal promising
perspectivos; in this we have been encouraged by the. Division.
We have, also, managed to keep our NOC officers! morale quite
high (more so than elsewhere, I am told by LPGLOBE people),
have kept them busy and productive, and have integrated them
into the Station, without loss of security, to a degree I
think unmatched elsewhere. Among the ways we have done this
are by grouping them together and delegating authority to a
NOC unit chief (although the report says that I have failed
to delegato authority properly), and by assigning them their
own areas of operational responsibility and having them do
the Station's operational planning in those areas. This bas
been productive: it has identified promising areas of
possible action which have led to recruitments, and has
eliminated less promising areas, thereby avoiding waste
motion on the part of the Station as a whole.

The last six lines of paragraph 2A. of the fitness report
are unclear to me. If the "possible loss of leadership" of
the NOC component refers to the impending retirement of its
chief, this is manifestly not due to any failure to delegate


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 129

COMMENTS continued                                                                                                   Page 4

to him responsibility and authority; he never in his long
career had nearly as much of either as he did during my
tenure here; he retired because he reached the age of 50,
beset by family problems and facing a change in his cover job,
and this in the face of repeated and recent failures to be
promoted despite having spent more than 10 years in grade.

The report states 1), that physical divisions within the
official Station made close teamwork difficult; 2), that I
could and should have corrected them. This is erroneous on
both counts. The Station, under my direction and that of
fifteen years of my predecessors, had to occupy this allotted
space, divided because there were two different cover
organizations and not enough space inthembassy. I am not aware
that this division has significantly affected the performance
of any Station officers or programs as long as I have been
here. As to what space assignments would best promote
teamwork (i.e., who should sit where), I have given thought
to this since my first week at this Station, and am convinced
(despite musings about this or that alternative) that we have
had no choice better than the present arrangement. Most
recently, however, I have approved our part of a general
shifting of Embassy space allocations which will finally
reunify the Station after its long separation.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT : Tennent H. Bagley, GS-16, Employee
Number 056043, DOB: 11 November
1925; Chief of Station; Career;
Service Designation: D.

PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 1 April 1969 - 31 March 1970

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 24

OVERALL RATING : Outstanding

1. For this reporting period Mr. Bagley must be rated as Outstanding for the achievements of his Station, achievements in very considerable measure due to his personal vision of how to mount a broad attack against the Soviet target. This vision is an unconventional one, not duplicated anywhere else in Europe, but it is undeniably producing results in terms of an understanding in depth of the activities of the Soviet representation in Belgium and of the character of a number of its individual members.

2. Mr. Bagley has developed a relationship with the chief of the principal liaison service in Belgium of such nature that this service is for practical purposes an arm of Brussels Station. Through this relationship, the Station is able to exercise a large measure of control over that service's requirements, selection of targets and mode of operation. Needless to say, this has been of very great help in pursuing Agency's goals in Belgium.

3. Although Mr. Bagley has not yet been completely successful in the organization of his complement of non-official cover personnel, his innovative approach has resulted in enormous progress over the past year, and I have good reason to believe that, with the implementation of certain measures which he and I recently discussed, he will be getting much more out of his NOC people than any other station chief in Eürope.

4. I was also impressed on my most recent visit, during the last part of April 1970, with what seemed to be an improved

communication between Mr. Bagley and his subordinates, both
inside and outside of the official cover installation. Pete
Bagley's intellectual capabilities tend to outstrip those of
most of his colleagues, but it does seem to me that he has dealt
with this_problem well and has thus been able to engender loyalty.
and cohesion among the members of his Station.

Mr. Tennent H. Bagley

1. It is recommended that Mr. Tennent H. Bagley be promoted to GS-17. He has been in grade as GS-16 since June 1965 and has served as COS in Brussels since August 1967. His previous assignment was as Deputy Chief, SB Division.

2. The reasons for this promotion are amply covered in my fitness report of this same date. I have just returned from an extensive trip through the European area, during which I had a chance to see and talk with a very large number of officers under both official and non-official cover. Pete Bagley is one of two whom I am recommending for promotion as a result. He is one of our very finest station chiefs, possessed of imagination, intellect and ability personally to handle operations which very few of his colleagues can match. He is one of those on whom the future of the Organization is going to depend, and I believe that the promotion is more than justified,

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this section or for reviewing officer's comments.)

I cannot of course comment on the professional aspects of the Chief CAS's performance because of the highly specialized nature of his responsibilities.

However as a member of the Country Team I give him the highest marks for his cooperative spirit, courtesy and willingness to contribute to the success of our common efforts and undertakings.

Likewise I am satisfied that he maintains exceptionally close and effective relations with the appropriate Belgian officials.

III. Endowed with an unusually frank and attractive personality, the Chief CAS is a respected and well liked member of our official American group in, Belgium, both in American and local circles, where his fluent and excellent French is much appreciated.

His wife is a refined, quiet and attractive lady of Austrian birth. Both have gone through an agonizingly long and grave health problem with a young son of theirs and deserve extraordinary credit for the courage and dignity which they constantly displayed during their ordeal.

In every respect, I consider him to be an outstanding CAS Station Chief.

Since the Chief CAS reported to post in September of this year, sufficient time has not elapsed to make a definite evaluation of his performance. A performance evaluation covering his full period at post will be made at the time of the next annual assessment period on November 1, 1968. Having said this, I might add that his approach to his job and performance to date in addition to his obvious ability and experience have confirmed my earlier, most favorable impressions of him.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT : Tennent H. Bagley, GS-16, Employee
Serial Number 056043; DOB:
November 11, 1925; Chief of
Station; Career; Sérvice
Designation: D.

PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 10 March 1968 - 31 March 1969

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 12

OVERALL RATING : Strong

1. Mr. Bagley assumed his duties as Chief of Station on 13 September 1967. It is too early to assess the results of his stewardship; he established in advance a timetable for building up a structure of unilateral agent assets, and it is not yet clear to what extent these assets are going to be productive against major targets. However, there is no doubt that Bagley has tackled his job with originality, energy, and enthusiasm. A good indication of these qualities is that, alone among our European Chiefs of Station, Bagley has himself recruited at least half a dozen new agent assets in less than two years.

2. Bagley's accomplishments must be measured in light of the fact that he has had a weak Deputy Chief of Station, and that several of the officers in his small Station have been of quite modest calibre. The restaffing of the Station which is taking place this summer should result in a considerable leap forward.

3. On the personal side, Bagléy has all the qualities which we could ask for in a Chief of Station. He is totally dedicated, incisive and articulate, a pleasant companion and a gracious host. I rate his overall performance as Strong.

Chiefs of Station Seminar No. 11
19 - 30 June 1967
80 hours, full time

Participant : BAGLEY, Tennent H.
Office : DDP/EUR

Year of Birth: 1925
Service Designation: D

Grade : GS-16
No. of Students : 12

EOD Date : July 1950

## COURSE OBJECTIVES, CONTENT AND METHODS

The COS Seminar is aimed to prepare prospective Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of Station and Chiefs of Base for field assignments. Emphasis was upon the difficulties confronting Chiefs of small or medium-sized installations, since they must handle a peculiarly wide range of problems. Included were case studies serving to remind outgoing chiefs of various operational approaches and techniques, but more time was devoted to policy, coordination, management, reporting, and administrative responsibilities of the Chief of Station, both within CIA and in the government at large, at home and abroad. Special attention was given to counterinsurgency.

The bulk of the course is given in lectures and question periods conducted by officials responsible for the missions, functions, programs, and services discussed. A few key items of suggested reading are included, and bibliographies of suggested reading tailored to the individual's assignment are offered for those who want them.

## ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance. No further assessment of individual capacity or performance is made in this course.

Mr. Bagley's performance over the period continued to be outstanding. This was his first full year as general deputy during which he still retained responsibility for a major, sensitive counterintelligence complex. Nevertheless, during my frequent absences, Mr. Bagley was called upon to act for me and he did so most effectively. Those aspects of his work involving decisions on expenditures of both funds and manpower show him to be sufficiently cost conscious yet this is tempered by a better than average awareness of the operational value to the Agency (or lack thereof) of such expenditures. Mr. Bagley has been selected to become COS of a large European station with excellent potential for Soviet Bloc operations. In my view, this appointment is additional testimony of the high regard in which he is held by his professional colleagues. In recognition of his outstanding work in SB Division, Mr. Bagley has been recommended for promotion to GS-17.

Employee Serial Number - 056043

From the beginning of the reporting period until 9 September 1965, Mr. Bagley continued as Chief, Counterintelligence Group, SR Division. Mr. Bagley was then appointed Deputy Chief, SR Division and has remained in that position. He has served as Acting Division Chief on several occasions including a period of two months in 1965 when I made an extensive visit to FE Division stations.

In Mr. Bagley's previous position as Chief, Counter- intelligence Group, he completed the establishment of this group as an effective mechanism for providing support and direction to CS operations against the Soviet Intelligence Services. His imprint can be seen in the functional organization of the various branches of the group which now enables us to concentrate on those aspects of KGB and GRU operations which are essential to the comprehensive and aggressive program we have underway to penetrate these key Soviet targets. I have been particularly impressed by Mr. Bagley's ability to relate the goals of these operational programs to the capabilities of his subordinates. In fact, his appreciation of their strengths and weaknesses enabled him to place the very best of his officers in key positions in the CI Group where for the most part they remain today. Their performance is still characterized by the high sense of discipline and professionalism imbued in them by Mr. Bagley during his service as their chief. I have also been struck by the spirit of loyalty permeating this group even though Mr. Bagley's associates were often driven at a pace which would have severely tested the supervisor/subordinate relationship in most other mits.. At the same time, he afforded the senior officers of the CI Group every opportunity for the exercise of initiative and imaginative leadership at their own levels. On the

other hand, he has little patience with the "time server"
who is not prepared to exert himself either to acquire
by self study the background he shouldhave to do his job
properly.or if he has the background to use it effectively
in his work......

Moving into the responsibilities of deputy division
chief, Mr. Bagley has demonstrated to my satisfaction that
he was the best possible choice for this position. He
has easily mastered those substantive areas of the divi-
sion's work with which he had no previous association or
encountered only occasionally as Chief, CI Group. This
is especially true of the reports and requirements area
and of certain collection activities.

Mr. Bagley's performance in the position of deputy
chief has indeed been outstanding. I would accord hậm
hartishishmaping and expand the
particularly high marks for the energy and enthusiasm he
orientation programs conducted by the division as one
means of conveying to CS officers outside the division
some understanding of the Soviet target and our methods
of operating against it. Mr. Bagley continues to be sen-
sitive to costs whether one is speaking of funds or man-
hours. Ile does not lightly undertake the expenditure of
cither. My very positive evaluation of Mr. Bagley's po-
tential for senior leadership in the Clandestine Service
has not changed. Ile is a magnificent intelligence officer
whose keen intellect and rapidly growing appreciation of the
"art of the possible" mark him as one of the best officers
in our service. It is my intention to recommend him for
promotion at an early opportunity.

Mr. Bagley still occupies the position described in his last fitness report of 30 April 1964. The quality of his performance continues to be outstanding in all respects including cost consciousness. He has been recommended for promotion to GS-16. This recommendation should receive early consideration. There are certainly very few officers in the GS-15 level who are more deserving in terms of their executive potential and their contributions to the mission of the Clandestine Services.

Although I have known and worked closely with Mr. Bagley many times over the past ten years, this is the first time he has served directly under me. This experience has confirmed my belief that he is without question one of the most gifted counterintelligence-officers in the Clandestine Services. The past several months have seen many changes in the organization of the SR Division and in its operational responsibilities. It should be noted that Mr. Bagley perhaps more than any other officer in the division contributed heavily to the broad concepts and ideas which took final form in the new organization and the operating instructions which were accepted in the Clandestine Services as a basis for an expanded effort against the overall Soviet target. At the same time he produced a number of specific plans and directives pertaining to the conduct of our operations against the Soviet intelligence services. These directives are representative of the depth of his experience in this field for they cover problems ranging from the often neglected but absolutely essential problem of collecting and recording data on Soviet intelligence officers to a highly imaginative program for increasing our level of contacts with such officers. In whatever he has undertaken in this regard, the quality of imagination is probably the most outstanding but his work would not be as effective as it is were it not for his amazing fund of knowledge concerning the Soviet intelligence services, their personnel, organization and operations, and just as important, awareness of the level and nature of the western counter intelligence effort.

BAGLEY, Tennent Ha

SECTION C (Continued)

This substantive background lends a quality of toughness and realism to his work as a planner and supervisor which is matched by very few others in the Clandestine Services.

As a supervisor, Mr. Bagley distinguishes himself by the ability he has to be immensely interested in the details of his subordinates' operations while at the same time leaving to them sufficient freedom of decision and action to carry out their programs without undue interference. He retains control over a large element (there are four branches and 55 employees in the group) and several first class senior subordinates by virtue of their respect for his competence and substance. More important, he infuses them with the same sense of dedication and deep enthusiasm for his work he himself possesses.

In his position Mr. Bagley also handles certain sensitive operations directly. All of the qualities of imagination, penetrating insight, energy and protessional knowledge which can be seen in his work as a supervisor are present in his case work. the has also demonstrated that he is a superb agent handler with a fresh, common sense approach to tradecraft problems. I have also seen him display a constant readiness to sacrifice his own comfort, leisure and private affairs to the demands of the operational situation. ile is not long discouraged in the most difficult circumstances and his natural optimism, alert mind and special kind of clan work constantly to discover new avenues of approach to whatever operational problems he faces.

I would describe his cost consciousness by noting that it is simply, foreign to his nature in both a personal and professional sense to use funds thoughtlessly. He has demonstrated that he considers the expenditure of operational funds must be related to a commensurate gain in terms of our operational objectives.

Mr. Bagley is an exceptionally skilled officer in the CE field. His knowledge of the Soviet intelligence services is almost unique in the Agency. After accomplishing the assigned task of reorganizing his Branch into a streamlined and operationally active unit, Mr. Bagley is now in the process of actively directing the planning and implementation of an aggressive effort on a world-wide basis against the Soviet intelligence services. Although in his present position only four months he has shown considerable imagination and initiative. He carries out his managerial duties in a proficient manner. He does however tend to avoid necessary but perhaps unpromising tasks. Inclined to be intolerant of those who do not meet the high standards he sets for himself, Mr. Bagley can be uncompromising in professional matters to the detriment of his relationships with others.

This employee is a dedicated and hard-driving operational specialist whose performance in the field on his last tour is well known and respected in the highest Clandestine Services levels. His services were sought after by this Division as Chief of its CI Branch. He was instructed to reorganize and redirect the Division's CI effort and to reorganize the Branch into an aggressive operational unit. He has tackled this with his characteristic aggressiveness and competence and has done extremely well in this undertaking. He has perhaps not paid as much attention to "channels and chains of command" as he should but I believe he understands the importance of a little more tolerance along these

TO:
Chief, EB

ATTN: David E. Murphy

FROM: Chief of Station, Bern

SUBJECT: Memorandum in Lieu of Final Fitness Report on

Tennent Bagley

1.  will be leaving Bern Station permanently, with reassignment to Headquarters on 5 September 1982. During his four and a half years here his performance has been highly professional and consistently outstanding. His absence will be really felt by the Station,

2.  Endowed with a high degree of intelligence, judgment, imagination and operational skill, and with fluent French, German and useful Russian, he has worked in every aspect of Station endeavor, ranging from the proper organization of Station records and the planning of operations to the assessing and successful recruiting and running of agents.

3.  In his primary responsibility as Station CI and Sovsat referent, has made unique contributions to KUBARK's approach to and knowledge of the field of Soviet and Polish CI, including the detection and monitoring of RIS illegal networks, and he has played a significant role in almost every major operation conducted by the Station over the last four years. His work has been repeatedly commended by Headquarters.

4.  Though natural bent is in the field of CE, in which he excels, he has acquitted himself equally well in other areas of Station activity. He is particularly adroit at the analysis, planning and management of operations and, from time to time, has supervised all Station operational activity with superior executive ability. His contribution to the development of Station liaison, through inquiries, follow-ups and special studies prepared to stimulate the local service to action in shall's behalf, has been indispensable and unquestionably an important factor in the growth of Swiss-KUBARK liaison.

# SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCEONNEL.
Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C. and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Subject is a thoroughly professional intelligence officer endowed with a high degree of intelligence and ability to concentrate. He is imaginative and skilled. A rapid, accurate and purposeful worker, he is a good writeMandanarticulate speaker. Though his natural bent is in the CE field, in which he excels, he has also demonstrated ability and accomplishments in other areas of Station activity. He is particularly adroit at the analysis, planning and management of his operations. His contribution to the Station liaison take (through inquiries, follow-up and special studies he has prepared to stimulate liaison to action in KUBARK's behalf) has been outstanding and has been a vital factor in stepping up the pace of Swiss-KUBARK liaison. Subject tends at times to avoid necessary but unpromising Station chores and at times is intolerant of those who do not meet the very high standards he sets for himself. These are minor flaws in an otherwise superior officer with outstanding potential.

I concur completely in the supervisor's estimate and would state that Subject is the most outstanding all around officer in the Station.

## SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicute suggestions made to employed for Improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his-training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming grenter responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

SEP 10 11 32 AM 59

1.  Subject is an exceptionally strong Case Officer in terms of initiative, imagination and skill. his greatest assets are a thorough understanding of intelligence techniques, native intelligence and the ability to apply both to operational situations. He is a rapid, accurate and purposeful worker with unusual powers of concentration, a good writer and articulate speaker. Although reasonably versatile, he has become a specialist in the CE field, for which he seems particularly well suited by natural talent and personality. Most of his work in his current position has required analysis, coordination and "desk" management of operations rather than actual agent handling and his performance in dealing with some fairly complex operational situations has been superior in every respect. He has used his cover intelligently.

State Dept

2.  By virtue of his intellectual capacity and intense interest in his work, Subject's potential for further development must be rated high. However, he should attempt to bring more flexibility and understanding into his relations with others. His views tend to be very positive and sometimes are argued with more vigor than tact. These are minor weaknesses in an otherwise exceptionally promising officer.

SECTION I۷

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable or unfavorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment. The descriptive words are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks; this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left - then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means that you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

DIRECTIONS. Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

The high ratings given Mr. Bagley are given in full consciousness of their uniqueness
in this Division. Mr. Bagley's all-around competence, his professional integrity,
devotion to duty, his thorough grasp of clandestine operations and particularly his
comprehension of CS matters and Soviet and Satellite intelligence services are of the
highest order and, in my opinion, therefore deserve this type of recognition.

Mr. Bagley can be impatient with the less gifted, intolerant of bureaucratic necessi-
ties, or uncompromising in professional matters. These traits are listed here not to
detract from his professional competence or personal qualities, but to indicate that
his supervisory talents are not yet fully developed. Mr. Bagley speaks fluent French
and German.

SECTION D.

pertinent personal characteristics or habits, special defects or talents....and how he fits in with your team. Com-
pore him with others doing similar work of about the same level.

RANT HIS SEPARATION

4. COMMENTS CONCERNING POTENTIAL:

Mr. Bagley's potential as a Clandestine Services operation officer is limited only by his relative youth and symptoms such as occasional impatience and doggedness. His intellectual gifts and professional competence are beyond question and qualify him for any operational job within DD/P in due course.

# SECTION N. FUTURE PLANS

1. TRAINING OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL EXPERIENCE PLANNED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

Mr. Bagley would probably profit from a short exposure to high-level staff work by increasing his knowledge of the U.S. intelligence community.

2. NOTE OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN INDIVIDUAL'S FUTURE ASSIGNMENTS

None.

SECTION. V

A. WHAT ARE HIS OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS? A brilliant young man, devoted to his work. A superior reporter with outstanding memory and analytic facilities. A perceptive and alert case officer. Works hard, writes well and easily. Keeps on top of his work and reporting to an unusual degree. Adapts easily to overseas life and has considerable charm and social presence. Speaks very useful German and fluent French.

B. WHAT ARE HIS OUTSTANDING WEAKNESSES?
Lack of team spirit. Impatience with the less gifted. Difficulty delegating responsibility. These weaknesses add up to a certain intellectual and social snobbery which could, if continued, unnecessarily restrict Subj's horizons in the broadest aspects of possible future assignments. They will have little effect on his operational brilliance but will not enhance his ability to pass on his experience to others, or to supervise and guide them. Experience over the last couple of years indicates that he will need assistance in his and his failings, minor though they may be, should regularly be brought

## SECTION IV

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment. The descriptive wording should be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are first assist categories of descriptions. The scale within each phrase is divided into three small blocks: this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at each statement on the left - then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applied to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have a definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

1. Subject is a brilliant young intelligence officer. He is unusually intelligent, quick and perceptive. He writes forcefully, organizes his material well and and has an excellent manner and presence. He is vitally interested in his work and has made a systematic study of it, particularly of the counter espionage aspect. He is well read and has an unusually good grasp of politics and has an excellent background in history. He has travelled in Europe considerably and has lived abroad (on his own hook) much of his adult life. In Vienna, he has learned German well...

CONCENTIAL

2.  Subject's weaknesses, which because of his outstanding ability and promise are rather magnified in this assessment, lie mainly in his occasionally faulty human relations. Subject rejects much of the social life which is customarily associated (although not necessarily for the best) with Kubark field posts. His interests, aside from his work, are primarily intellectual and artistic. These interests, coupled with his at best pro forma fulfilling of the customary Kubark social protocols, definitely weaken his relationship with the rest of the staff.

3.  Subject comes from a service environment and was himself a Marine officer when very young. This early environment and training has, probably without Subject's being aware of it, caused him to expect of others a devotion to duty and self discipline which is rarely to be found. These high standards have caused Subject to discount to some degree the abilities of the clerical staff and, to a lesser degree, other junior personnel.

4.  A second weakness probably results from Subject's consistently successful career. He has, without any effort on his own part, frequently if not invariably found himself closely associated with management" and regarded by the management" as being unusually talented. This has caused him to expect his work to receive spécial attention which is not always warranted. When this does not happen, he tends to pout.

5.  There is no question in the writer's mind but what Subject would be an outstanding addition to any office in the Agency. He has, as far as can be seen now, an unlimited growth potential. His minor faults will correct themselves with maturity and increasing experience.

# KAPOK

23 September 1953

1. Subject has completed a two-year tour at VOB and after home leave has returned here for another two years. Initially assigned to VOB under Embassy cover, Subject has now transferred to D/A civilian cover. Since his arrival in Vienna, Subject has come through a rather long apprenticeship wherein he was exposed to a variety of intelligence problems, including the organization of counter-intelligence files, the handling of two American deep cover agents, the training and mounting of an Hungarian border crosser, and the direction of an Austrian double agent. At this time, Subject is head of the Mission CE section. He has organized that section efficiently and has arranged the expeditious handling of routine CI problems. He is now prepared to undertake more creative CE work.

2. Subject has a notably orderly mind, unusual intelligence, and a remarkable interest in his work. He is able to handle a variety of tasks at one time. Although Subject has had a variety of agent-handling experience, unfortunately, he has not had the opportunity to handle many agents. We intend to correct this in the next few months by having him handle a series of operations during the developmental stages. We believe this will give him the experience and depth necessary to support his already good theoretical knowledge. Subject is extremely well disciplined personally. Unfortunately, and unrealistically, he sometimes expects other persons to have similar self-discipline. He also tends in other ways to disregard the human elements ever present in intelligence operations. However, there is no question in my mind but shat additional experience will cure both of these very minor faults.

3. I have every reason to believe that Subject will be ready for important operational assignments either in Washington or in the fiold after another two years of field experienco.

Subject appears to be an excellent prospect for operational work. He is intelligent, quick to learn and hard working. He approaches problems systematically and with forethought. He has an excellent background in history and is well up on current events. The lack of fluency in German is the only liability noted in his first 90 days here. At present subject is working hard on German.

TO:

Employees Division

VIA:

FROM:

FDM

SUBJECT: Tennent H. Bagley

Mr. Bagley has been recalled to active duty as a First Lieutenant in the Marine Corps with effective date 11 December 1950. The order is by letter MC-1243761 of Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps, Washington, D. C., dated 3 November 1950 and addressed to his home in La Jolla, California (copy attached).
Since Mr. Bagley is on duty in Washington, he did not receive the order until 13 November 1950.

Mr. Bagley was employed by this Agency on 24 July 1950 as a Research Analyst assigned to the Advisory Council. Since reporting for duty, he has been in the Training Courses and will complete the Advanced Operations Course on 1 December 1950. During this period, however, it has been agreed that his qualifications could best be utilized as an Intelligence Officer in Germany, and the papers are now in requesting his transfer to FDM for that purpose.

Request that Mr. Bagley's deferment from recall to active duty with the Marine Corps be arranged on the grounds that his work in the Training Courses has shown him to be unusually well qualified for intelligence work in Germany and that men of his caliber and background are still badly needed by the German Station. If this deferment can be arranged, he will be sent to Germany as S-9 Intelligence Officer at the earliest opportunity.

   action may be revoked and the subject will be made a free agent.
