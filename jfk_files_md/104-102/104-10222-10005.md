Thomas Kunan (LA)

Dear Tom,

Please accept my appreciation for an assignment well done as a member of the FY 1977 GS-13 Evaluation Board.

Your full-time service with the Board represents a major contribution to the Directorate's program of personnel assessment and management. Your recommendations for promotion, career development, and other matters have been very helpful.

I believe you will find on return to your regular duties that this time spent with the Board has broadened and sharpened your own focus on the personnel aspects of Agency management. I think it will make you appreciate more than ever our need for carefully and candidly written appraisals of employees.

Sincerely,

I Standley

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-1S
Thomas J. Keenan

1. WH Division recommends that Mr. Thomas J. Keenan be promoted to GS-15.

2. Mr. Keenan has been serving as COS, Kingston since October 1973. He was selected for this important position as a result of the high level of performance turned in by him in his previous field tour as Deputy Chief of Station, Lima. In Kingston he has inherited a Station in which, because of circumstances beyond control of Agency personnel, the incumbent faces enormous operational and circumstantial difficulties. The Ambassador was declared persona-non-grata last summer and concomitantly both the attitude of the local security services with which we conduct liaison and the attitude of Jamaican personalities of import has become increasingly hostile. Mr. Keenan thus faces a great challenge in rebuilding operational activities practically from scratch. In spite of the short time in which he has been in place he is off to a promising start and has already demonstrated the qualities of leadership and imagination which we expected of him. He has shown soundness In directing his two subordinate officers and in counseling them on how to achieve desired objectives in specific operational situations. He has likewise maintained excellent relations with the acting principal officer who in turn has shown himself to be a strong supporter of the Station's efforts.

3. It is noteworthy that Mr. Keenan has been able to maintain the Station's morale at an acceptable levelin the face of the extremely difficult law and order situation in Kingston where personnel must live in constant daily fear for the well-being of their dependents.

6. This Division believes that the performance of Mr. Keenan in this initial period of his first experience as Chief of Station amply justifies the confidence and trust placed in him when he was chosen to occupy that position.

MEMORANDUM FOR JIM LUDLUM

SUBJECT: COURTESIES EXTENDED BY CIA PERSONNEL
DURING MY RECENT TRIP TO LATIN AMERICA

I want to thank you most sincerely for the courtesies extended by your Station Chiefs and other personnel during my recent visit to Latin America.

Without exception, your people were most gracious and helpful.

They were also forthright with respect to both their activities and their problems in dealing with the narcotics target.

It was quite apparent that you and Ted Shackley have succeeded in conveying to the field the message about what the Agency is supposed to be doing in the drug field.

If the appropriate occasion should arise, I would appreciate conveying my appreciation to Messrs. Horton, Kiyonaga, Reife, Keenan, Thayer, Dickens and Millian.

Your assignment may be terminated earlier for the convenience of this organization and the length of your tour of duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organization in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour of your cover facility. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed above from the date of arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your dependents to the United States at Government expense. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed one (1) year of service from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will be required to reimburse the Government for all of its expenses for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependents, from the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.

3. Travel to your post of duty overseas and your return travel to the United States, as well as travel performed overseas which is consistent with your cover designation, will normally be at the direction of your cover facility. Each travel will be accomplished in conformance with applicable regulations of your cover facility except when you are directed for operational reasons to perform travel in accordance with the regulations of this organization.

4. Salary and (except as provided in paragraph three (3) above) allowances paid by your cover facility shall be retained by you to the extent that they are less than or equal to the salary and allowance payments due on the basis of your grade level with this organization. If such cover payments are less than the amount due, the difference will be credited to your payroll account with this organization. If such cover payments exceed the amount due, the overage will be remitted to this organization at designated intervals, presently

Computations hereunder will be made on the basis of the aggregate gross due and received provided, however, that in computing remittances for overage Federal and, if applicable, District of Columbia income taxes withheld by your cover facility against the overage may be deducted. To assure timely accuracy in your payroll account with this organization you are expected to immediately report cover facility payroll changes.

5. Your status as an employee of this organization will continue in full force and effect during your period of duty with your cover facility and you will continue to be entitled to all rights, benefits and emoluments of such status. Certain variations in procedure will be required, however, to preserve the security of your cover position.

a. Upon integration into your cover facility, you will continue to be covered by the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended, and at your personal expense you will be subject to payroll deductions for retirement purposes (now six and one-half per cent) on the basis of your cover salary or your salary from this organization, whichever is the greater.

b. If you receive taxable income from both your cover facility and this organization, necessary adjustments for Federal, and if applicable, District of Columbia income tax purposes will be made in conformance with instructions received from this organization.

c. Consistent with your cover activity, you will continue to be responsible for compliance with the rules and regulations of this organization.

d. You are not assured upon the completion of your period of duty with your cover facility of any status with your cover based on your services performed with that organization at the request of this organization.

6. All annual and sick leave which is accrued to your credit at the time of integration will be transferred to your cover facility. While integrated you will be permitted annual leave, sick leave, home leave, and leave without pay in accordance with the regulations of your cover facility in lieu of the leave benefits of this organi-ation. Upon completion of your integration your accrued annual and sick leave will be transferred to your credit with this organization. If security conditions require that your cover facility make a lump-sum payment for accrued annual leave, you will be required to pay the gross amount thereof to this organization including any income taxes withheld by your cover facility.

6. You will be required to keep forever secret this agreement and all other information which you may obtain by reason hereof, unless you are released in writing by this organization from this obligation. Violation of such secrecy may subject you to criminal prosecution under the Espionage Laws, dated 25 June 1948, as amended; and other applicable laws and regulations. The termination of your employment with this organization will not release you from the obligation of any security oath you may be required to take.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Panel, Section A

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion: Thomas J. Keenan

1. The promotion of Mr. Thomas J. Keenan to GS-13 is strongly recommended. Mr. Keenan embodies the principal qualities of the all-around operations officer. He is intelligent, perceptive, and analytical. He quickly grasps the essentials of a problem. He is aggressive, very industrious, and always works effectively. His field experience consists of two tours of duty in Mexico where he began as a junior case officer and developed rapidly to the point where he was handling an extremely heavy load of important and complex cases. He operated against Soviet Bloc and related targets, ran support projects, surveillance teams, and technical operations. The experience he gained was broad in nature. Also involved was the supervision of up to 30 people, including other officers and indigenous personnel and agents. Mr. Keenan himself responds extremely well to enlightened supervision and is quick to profit from the guidance of his supervisors.

2. For the past two years Mr. Keenan has worked on the FI Staff of the WH Division providing supervision and guidance for FI/CI activities of the Division. He has been most effective in this role which requires dealing on a day-to-day basis with officers, many of whom are senior to him.

3. He participated as the Number 2 man on a Headquarters Task Force supporting the President's visit to Mexico last year. His work was highly effective. Mr. Keenan demonstrated a thorough knowledge of Headquarters' procedures and an ability to get things done. Mr. Keenan will shortly be assigned as


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 36

-2-

Operations Officer to Bogota, Colombia where there are targets of an increasingly serious nature requiring highly professional operational approaches.

4. Based on his experience and proven ability demonstrated by sound accomplishments as a case officer and as a Headquarters staff assistant, Mr. Keenan is regarded as having superior potential. It is recommended that he be promoted to GS-13.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
WASHINGTON,. D.C 20505

TO : Thomas Keenan

SUBJECT: TDY in the Dominican Republic

Most of you who went down to the Dominican Republic
departed with so much speed and so little ceremony that
there was no time to explain the importance and urgency
of your assignments. Now that you have served there
during the crisis, the importance of the task needs no
embellishment from us, but you should know that the con-
tribution of the augmented Station was decisive in shaping
the policies and actions of the government and in avoiding
several major mistakes. For weeks after the April revolu-
tion, our Station reporting was literally the only source
of information that the United States had on the role of
Communism among the rebel forces and on conditions outside
the capital.

Many fine things were done in the Station and in the
hinterland by all of you. Manning the check-points under
fire, flying to remote and hostile villages, moving tons
of supplies through the gauntlet of the communications
line, toiling over midnight reports, and keeping open our
country's only commo link -- all these things were common-
place. The dedication, discipline, and routine of our
personnel placed them in a class apart.

To the sense of pride and accomplishment you must
already feel, I want to add the gratitude and and admiration
of the DDP and of the Agency.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Panel (Section B)

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-12
Mr. Thomas J. Keenan

1. It is recommended that Thomas J. Koenan be promoted to GS-12.

2. Mr. Keenan is thirty-four years old and has been with the Agency since 1957. While in grade as GS-11 only for the past year or so, he has been performing at a level even higher than the proposed GS-12 for more than three years, supervising the activities of up to twenty-five agents including a GS-13 contract agent.

3. The following quotation from the latest annual fitness report represents the best justification for this request:

> "Subject's duties and responsibilities involve management and supervision of some of this Station's most successful and most sensitive opcrations. The fact that Subject has responsibilities comparable to any officer up to four grades higher than his speaks for the trust COS has in him and for his continued exceptionally proficient performance."

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CS/CS Panel (Section C)

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade 08-10
Mr. Thomas J. Keenan

1. Thomas J. Keenan entered on duty with CLA on 20 May 1957 as a Junior Officer Trainee. He was assigned to WH Division for a one year tour effective 6 January 1958 and was changed to staff employee on 25 January 1959. He served ably as operations officer on the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican desk. Since 3 February 1960 he has been an Operations Officer at the Mexico City Station.

2. Keenan is equipped intellectually and emotionally to do fine work, and his potential for a good career is high. He is alert and conscientious. He takes on new tasks readily and accomplishes his objectives with thoroughness and dispatch. He is enthusiastic and imaginative. He gets on well with his co-workers and is highly motivated. Keenan always makes a good impression and works diligently. He is a very pleasant individual, interested and cooperative, and gives promise of being a sound intelligence officer.

3. The above recommendation has been submitted previously under the dates of 12 August 1959, 5 January 1960 and 30 June 1960. An efficiency report from the Mexico City Station dated 12 December 1960 states that Mr. Keenan is an unusually effective case officer and is making an outstanding contribution to CLA operations in that area. This report further indicates that Keenan has been assigned duties which would normally be performed by a much senior officer and has carried them out in a most commendable manner.

4. On the basis of his qualifications and past performance, it is recommended that Mr. Keenan be promoted to Grade 08-10.

# NARRATIVE STATEMENT FOR THE PROMOTION OF THOMAS J. KEENAN

1.  After attending IOC and IT, in which he made excellent grades, Keenan was placed on an interim basis with WE/Spain for four weeks. He then entered 153 Training, where he again did excellent work. He then was placed for three months with the CI/ICD -- he has evinced interest in CE work -- before he was assigned for on-the-desk training with WI/3. On 3 March he entered OC and will return to WI/3 upon the completion of this course. Interim evaluation from OC shows that Keenan has four satisfactory grades. Throughout his training, formal and on-the-desk, Keenan has been commended: "alert with definite potential for CE work - thorough and industrious - on the Mexican desk performance was excellent - gets along extremely well with associates - attitude toward Agency excellent - should rapidly develop into a valuable employee with high potential - a very pleasant young man, interested and cooperative - gives promise of being a sound intelligence officer."

2.  There is one other JOT under the supervisor. He is GS-9 and replaced subject, doing the same work, when subject left for OC. Subject's Spanish is not so well developed as that of the CS-9 JOT; otherwise there is little difference in their production.

3.  On the CI Staff subject's performance was equal to that of other JOT's under the supervisor. During his time on the desk with WI/3, Keenan's performance was at a level comparable to that of one other JOT of higher grade.

4.  Keenan came to the JOTP with a good college record and excellent experience as officer-in-charge of sixty officers and enlisted men in a Navy communications center. His rank was Lt(jg). He has a fair working knowledge of Spanish. To date he has shown high motivation, adaptability, and an intelligent approach to his job.

5.  Keenan has had no opportunity to demonstrate supervisory ability.

6.  WI/3 concurs in this promotion.

7.  It is recommended that Keenan be promoted from GS-7 to GS-9.

Keenan is a really impressive bllow in all rospects. His appearance is immaculate, there is a youthful charm about him, his discourse is articulate and nicely paced, and ho has a very congenial disposition. He has reached a sua satisfactory level of maturity and discretion, I have no doubt. He has humility and poise. He is now at a critical juncture Li his life--Just out of service, with an optimistic outlook on life, and anxious to enter into career employment. His attitudo toward govt. and CIA in particular to entirely favorable. After our initial interview ho wanted some time to think it over, and to have other interviews. He called me within a matter of days, saying he was ready to make formal application. Both he and his wife are enthusiastic over the JOT program. She is an attractive young lass who has lived most of her life in S. America where her father is an engineer for CMC. She is bi-lingual.
Keenan asked searching but discreet questions about conditions of employment, career development, and the like. He is familiar with the security environment, and anticipates no difficulty adapting himself to our requirements. Note his steady progress in the Navy Ho appears to co a natural for career training. He is a likeable fellow, full of curiosity and ambition, and I believe he has a good mind. Participation in the mission of the agency appeals to him very strongly. Presently not employed, he is prepared to seek temporary work if available, or simply to wait out the processing period. His interest is centered wholly in this application. In fairness to him an early decision on eligibility is advised.
I regard him as a wholesome, disciplined, energetic fellow, with real potential for us.
Self-administered tests will be forwarded soon.

# CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

Applicant Information
Sheet No, 1

To all persons applying for employment with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant status with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the conditions stated below;

General Considerations:

1.  The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the Agency the responsibility:

a. "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning such intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies as relate to the national security;

b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart- ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national security;

c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within the Government."

d. "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence agencies, such additional services of common-concern as the National Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished centrally;

e. "to perform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security Council may from time to time direct."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 80

The special character of this national responsibility requires the Agency to maintain correspondingly special employment criteria which may be different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Government departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive responsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows that the investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance is a time-consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks, includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness, and availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered. This is called "clearance" of an applicant.

2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware, perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are conclusive and final 'so far as the Agency is concerned, and no statement of specific reasons is made to the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk, taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants are not cleared.

Statement of Understanding and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Considerations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those considerations.

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2,

(Signature of Applicant)

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Thomas J. Keenan

1. During the first six weeks of the reviewing period, Mr. Keenan continued as Chief of the Mexico and Central America Branch, the Division's most demanding geographic unit. His performance during this period continued at the same Strong level detailed in the last Fitness Report.

2. During February, as part of a determined effort to strengthen the Division's Operations Staff, Mr. Keenan was moved up to fill one of the two Deputy Chief slots in that unit. As of 1 July, he was the sole Deputy of the Staff. As set up in Latin America Division, the Operations Staff had both staff and line functions. It had broad coordinating responsibilities with all elements outside the Division, served as the focal point for all senior staff requests for studies and reports, stimulated and coordinated Division operational activities and reviewed the effectiveness of Division programs. All Division operational traffic flowed through the Ops Staff where better than 80 per cent of the traffic was released.

3. Mr. Keenan was assigned primary responsibility for close review and staff action relating to the northern area (Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean plus Guyana and Surinam in South America). In addition, he served as the staff referent for narcotics operations throughout the Division and for Cuba operations worldwide.

4. I consider myself singularly fortunate to have had Mr. Keenan as my Deputy. I assumed the Chief/Ops responsibility in April 1977 and immediately discovered that ground rules were different, legal strictures impinged on many operational decisions, and the almost constant senior staff requests affected one's ability to concentrate on operations. Mr. Keenan was extremely helpful in providing substantive briefings, guiding me through the legal and policy complications and pointing out the shoals. He made many valuable suggestions on how to handle the work load without drowning in paper.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 146

5. Mr. Keenan has an agile and retentive mind. He
   is quick at distinguishing the wheat from the chaff. He
   does his homework and I have never known him to go off
   half cocked. In making operational judgments, his initiative
   is tempered by a healthy dose of prudence. Mr. Keenan's
   writing is first rate; his prose is lean, often elegant,
   and always precise. I have admired his talents as a
   briefer. His presentations are balanced and detailed,
   often spiced with his engaging humor.

6. Mr. Keenan's tenure with the Ops Staff was a very
   intensive period. He normally worked an eleven-hour day
   and Saturdays as well. I take some pride in the fact that
   there never developed an antagonist relationship between
   the operating branches and the Ops Staff. Mr. Keenan
   deserves much of the credit for this. While often taking
   issue with branch positions and written work, he was
   unfailingly courteous, good humored, and helpful. His
   counsel was often sought on difficult problems.

7. A significant and time-consuming aspect of the
   Ops Staff's work concerned screening operational traffic
   for compliance with E.0. 11905 and ensuring that U.S.
   person strictures were scrupulously observed. I found
   Mr. Keenan's general knowledge in these areas unmatched
   among the non-lawyers of the Agency..

8. Mr. Keenan shared with me the responsibility for
   supervising the work of two operations officers and one
   secretary. He is an excellent supervisor who manages
   (despite the belief of some that it is not possible) to be
   both exigent and pleasant. He cares about people, and as
   noted in the previous Fitness Report, takes special
   interest in developing younger officers.

9. In addition to his Operations Staff responsibil-
   ities, Mr. Keenan served as the Division EEO Officer. He
   also served for nine months on a time-consuming DDO task
   force concerned with a threat against President Carter's
   life. He performed these responsibilities with the same
   thoughtfulness and effectiveness he applies to everything
   else.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

10. The Operations Staff was disbanded in early November as part of the Latin America Division reorganization. In recognition of his splendid performance on the Ops Staff, Mr. Keenan was made Chief of a combined Coordination/Plans Staff with a T/O of six. This staff will retain most of the coordination functions of the Ops Staff but not the line functions.

11. This is a splendid officer, certainly one of the most promising GS-15's in the Division. He clearly earned an Outstanding rating for the period under review.

## COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL continued

While I personally handled the first week or so of the myriad problems associated with a wide-spread investigation of an alleged plot against President Carter, I subsequently turned the responsibility for it over to Mr. Keenan and he represented the Division with the DDO, CI Staff and Secret Service on this important and seemingly never ending problem area. This involved a lot of extra hours work and had to be handled meticulously. He performed these responsibilities impeccably.

During the past year he made many contributions to the smooth functioning of the division. Not least among them was the fact that having fully familiarized himself with US laws, Executive Orders, regulations, notices, etc., which have increasingly affected our operations programs, he ensured that our operational business was always in meticulous compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of these seemingly myriad "don'ts." Similarly, we had to produce staff papers in a hurry, often synthesizing a great deal of detail or alternatively presenting a great deal of detail. Mr. Keenan saw that the job was accomplished on time and with good style.

Although he was the junior member of the three-man Operations Staff, on occasion he served as the Acting Chief. He handled the COPS function with his usual dedication and good judgment.

As the rating officer has mentioned, when the division was reorganized in November, we decided to combine the Operations Staff's staff, but not command functions with those of the Plans Staff. Mr. Keenan was the obvious choice for this important and challenging assignment which will tax his abilities and broaden his experience. He is one of our best GS-15 officers and has additional growth potential in the Clandestine Service. He is a good operations officer as well as a good staff officer and is qualified to manage one of our medium-size Latin America Division Stations.

Branch Chief's attention, the other Stations, particularly Costa Rica, which has an active operational program, and the Guatemala Station, which also covers El Salvador, required regular attention and the lesser posts could not be neglected. The Branch performed well in these regards too. In short, I was pleased by the rapidity with which Mr. Keenan got on top of his responsibilities and by the intelligence, thoughtfulness, energy and professional skills he displayed in carrying them out.

Mr. Keenan is an intense, thorough, common sense, sound officer who while quick witted, thinks problems through, sees the holes and takes steps to fill them. He does his home work and doesn't go off half-cocked; yet he gets the job done quickly. He tends toward the conservative side in making judgments. While he has a pleasant way with people, he has firm convictions, and he is articulate, very forthright but not offensive in expressing what is on his mind. A strong supervisor, he is on top of the activities of his unit, demands results, isn't afraid to be firm with his subordinates but is thoughtful and concerned about their welfare. He cares a lot about people and is interested in developing younger officers assigned to him. Because of these qualities, he was selected to be the Division's FEO officer when we needed a new one a few months ago. He has performed this role in his usual thoughtful and efficient fashion. He writes quickly and well. No one is more conscientious than ho. He really cares about his job and tries to produce the best possible product. All in all, he was one of our best Branch Chiefs and deserves a solid "Strong" for his efforts.

In February 1977, one of the Deputy Chiefs of Operations jobs in the Division came open. Because of his demonstrated all around ability, personal qualifications and potential, he was selected from among the Branch Chiefs in the Division to fill that position. The job will broaden him and equip him for even more responsible posts in the field as either a Station Chief or for more senior positions at Headquarters. He is clearly one of our promising GS-15 officers.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Thomas J. Keenan

1 January - 31 December 1975

From January to July of this reporting period Mr. Keenan finished his tour as Chief of Station, Kingston. In addition to himself there were two other case officers at the Station. Its total complement was 7 persons. Mr. Keenan entered the Army War College in July 1975.

During the last six months of his tour, the Station had three things going for it; a good access agent operation against the PRC target, a one- on-one relationship between a Station officer and a Cuban Embassy officer, and further development and exploitation of a member of the ruling political party. Of these the latter turned out to be the most worthwhile. This agent provided useful information on key political developments in the Jamaican government and the government party relating to its growing relationship with the Cuban government. The relationship with the Cuban officer turned out badly since the Cuban pitched the Station officer rather than vice versa. During this period the PRC access agent was most promising and was the best operation of its kind against the PRC that the Division had.

Mr. Keenan's relations with the Embassy during this period were good. No problems of any kind were noted. The operational environment continued bad due to the high incidence of crime.

Mr. Keenan is an able, experienced officer with good personal presence. He is measured in his operational approach and in his management style. He is a man of good Judgment, has an agreeable personality and inspires confidence; he can be counted on to do a creditable job without a lot of fanfare.

In the last six months of his tour as Chief of Station, Kingston, I would rate his overall performance as "Strong."

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Mr. Keenan had departed Station Kingston/shortly after by the time I assumed charge of Latin America Division in May 1975. Therefore, I am not able to comment on his performance as Chief of Station, Kingston during the first five months of 1975. I would like to note, however, that Mr. Keenan served under me when I was Chief of Station, Bogota from 1965-1968 and I am acquainted with his personality and operational proficiency. On this basis, while I did not observe his performance as Chief of Station first hand, I generally concur with the Rating Officer's comments and overall performance evaluation of "Strong."

As a person, Mr. Keenan is a mature, dedicated officer with a pleasing personality. He gets along well with his peers and subordinates and is respected by them. I have selected him to be Chief of the Mexican and Central American Branch which is one indicator of the confidence I have In his ability. This will be an excellent test of Mr. Keenan's administrative and managerial ability since this branch is one of our largest in Latin America rivision.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Thomas J. Keenan
1 July 1974 - 31 December 1974

Mr. Keenan took over as COS Kingston in September 1974. This is his
first COS assignment. The Kingston Station is composed of 6 staff employees
(including 2 communicators) and I contract employee for a total complement
of 7.

As one of the principal Caribbean sources of bauxite, Jamaica is of
Importance to the U.S. The arbitrary taxes levied on the U.S. bauxite
company in Jamaica has been a source of conflict between the two governments.
There is a Cuban and Chinese presence in Jamaica. Perhaps the single most
Important factor affecting the environment and personal lives of our Station
members is the very high level of crime in Kingston, especially rape.

In reviewing the past fitness reports none has yet been written
specifically commenting on his performance as COS in Kingston. I will
attempt to fill that gap with this one.

The Station has been changed from basically a liaison Station to a
unilateral Station. Liaison has never been overly cooperative, but the
present COS has continued to develop the liaison, and at the same time has
moved out unilaterally. During the past year two access agents to the
Chinese target have been recruited (one being among the best in the Division)
and two access agents to the Cuban target. It has also acquired a penetration
of the local service who is especially useful against the Chinese target..
In addition, a surveillance team which was recruited in 1973 was developed
and used to the extent possible. The Station has become more active than
perhaps ever before in its history, with emphasis on the PRC and Cuban
targets.

From the past we know that Mr. Keenan is an excellent officer with good
operational instincts. After a year in Kingston as COS we now also see
that he can perform as a manager. Upon his return from Kingston this year
Mr. Keenan will attend the Army War College to continue his career development.
I rate his overall performance as COS in Kingston as "Strong."

I concur in the evaluation of strong. It should be pointed out that Mr. Keenan has been operating under very difficult circumstances for which I am responsible. It was on my recommendation that he was pulled out of Lima for Kingston. I remembered this as a Caribbean paradise, but later found out that it was a most difficult situation--especially for someone 11ke Mr. Keenan with a large family of small girls. Given this personal problem, it is understandable that Mr. Keenan did not perform in a more dramatic manner. He did quite well and w111, I think, benefit from his upcoming war.college stint.

This report is occasioned by Subject's early departure from Lima, before end of tour, to assume the duties of COS in Kingston, Jamaica. That fact alone attests the esteem in which he has been held by Hqs and, when the proposal for that assignment was made, also expressed once again by the rater.

Subject had not yet completed his first two years as a DCOS and this was his first crack at that level of responsibility. So his rise of late has been rapid, although of course it is based on abilities and experience developed and polished in the course of a number of tours overseas prior to his coming to Lima. These have all been spent in the Latin environment so the Caribbean will be for him a completely new world. This will be a healthy change for him and is managerially sound as well for the Station to which he is going.

As DCOS in Lima, Subject has shown a high order of operational soundness, administrative good sense, and a conscientiousness about his work that permitted COS to delegate without hesitation both specific problems in any area or even whole sections of Station activity (e.g. narcotics) for him to carry out or to supervise. Subject is a prudent man who thinks things through before acting. He weighs the pros and cons carefully, is quite CI-minded (an indispensible attribute in this semi-hostile climate), and then acts promptly. His judgment, while it tends to come down on the conservative side, is invariably soundly based. His periods of serving as Acting COS have been competently handled as well, always within his understanding of what the COS would want done if he were here.

As a supervisor, Subject has the right combination of patience and firmness when dealing with younger case officers who want to be off and running. He encourages their

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

There is little more that can be added to this eloquent report. Mr. Keenan's exceptional characteristics and abilities and his fine performance as DCOS, Lima, an unusually active, busy station, have led to his present assignment as COS, Kingston. The rating officer has stated that Mr. Keenan's rise of late has been rapid and this is true. However, all that he has achieved he has worked very hard for and certainly earned; and despite the fact he has a youthful face and a somewhat boyish manner, he is not all that young in years, so the present grade and position are hardly inconsistent with his age. Viewing the record and this man's potential, there is every reason to expect that he will continue to progress up the managerial ladder at essentially the same pace we have seen in the last three or four years.

aggressiveness but at the same time enlightens them on the virtue of looking over their shoulder at who may be after them as well as on the advantages of doing their homework first. Usually the upshot has proved him right.

In running his own cases, Subject is meticulous and very thorough, preparing himself for eventualities as well as maximum disseminable information. He has personally handled two difficult cases while here and has gotten what there was to be had out of both. Each also had serious flap potential but there has been not whiff of suspicion or of leakage.

Subject, as noted before, has a cherry exterior that covers a deeply serious person within. His easy and forthright manner has earned him friends in the official Embassy community and in the larger society as well. All respect his judgment, his seriousness about his work and the issues of our time, and his eminently decent family life. All of these qualities should go far to make his upcoming tour as a COS a success. We wish him well and expect in future to hear only good about him and his work.

This fine officer has been DCOS in Lima for nearly a year now, his first crack at this level of responsibility. And for nearly two months of that he was Acting COS during an interregnum which was made easier for Hqs to accept at the time because of Subject's already acknowledged ability and operational judgment.

This officer has many laudable qualities. He was an established, painstaking professional with solid operational background. He has now demonstrated that he is also good at management, at keeping things moving, and at finding time for the little details that so often make the difference. He has a healthy respect for the opposition services (international and local) and weighs his operational decisions carefully in the light of their capabilities. In his present DCOS (and ACOS) responsibilities, he also shows excellent political judgment, knowing what will wash and what probably won't, what is acceptable risk (all things considered) and what is probably asking for trouble. A prudent officer, he looks before he leaps-or asks officers to.

This officer also has an amiable personality, warm and forthcoming with all the people he deals with - and deals with the more effectively as a result. This amiability (and the obvious decency and quiet integrity of the man) does not for a minute, however, get in the way of a good mind getting quickly to the bottom of whatever subject or problem may be before him. He is especially effective working with junior officers and subordinates, explaining the background /CONTINUED/

of his decisions or analysis of the problem succinctly and tactfully.

Subject deserves the highest marks for his handling of several of the Station's problem cases, one a high level Government penetration considerably nervous about being an agent at all, another a foot-dragging egotist. Both of these important cases require quick thinking, gentle persuasion, and an adroit persistence in pushing BKCROWN's interests (offensive and defensive) in the midst of a welter of competing factors. Where a light but firm touch is needed, this officer cannot have many equals.

Subject is, as would be expected, held in high regard by his LNFALL colleagues and also by his Peruvian acquaintances. Ho is also (if the above does not say it) held in very high regard by the rator, who finds his advice on operational and political issues sound and finds him a person to whom any problem can be delegated in full confidence it will be handled fast and well. It is a pleasure to work with him.

The narrative statement in the last Fitness Report on Subject (HPLT-6074, 10 Jan 72) is still largely valid. This individual has in all ways proven himself as a keen, mature operations officer, supervisor and Deputy Chief of Station. Upon my departure (18 May 1972) he will be in charge for approximately six weeks until the new COS arrives. I have every reason to believe that during this period his actions and decisions will reflect credit on the Station and the organization in general. He enjoys the complete confidence and support of all Station personnel and is well-prepared to successfully meet the challenges which lie ahead.

It has been a special pleasure knowing and serving with such an officer.

The above represents the COS' end-of-tour rating of Mr. Keenan, and following fairly close on the heels of the previous fitness report, it adds little to the previous narrative.

Since the COS in Lima is physically located outside the Station area, Mr. Keenan's normal function is to serve as *de facto* chief of operations and office manager. With the COS' departure in May, Mr. Keenan was serving as Acting Chief of Station. He maintained the tempo of Station operations and activity under what have been for some time a rather hostile operational climate in Peru.

In the brief three months Subject has boon at the Station, he has moved rapidly not only to thoroughly acquaint hlmselt with his specific rosponsibilities but also with all aspects of the Station's activities. His oquable nature, ability to deal successfully with people of all descriptions and dispositions and solid operational background make him a most welcome member of the Station staff. As COS, I am particularly grateful for bis services.

Among his duties is that of supervising closely the activities of two Junior officers - which he does extremely well. Being one who readily commands respect, they readily seek him out for advise and consultation and are learning much under his masterly tutelage.

Subject is also coordinating Station efforts to penetrate the military and is already achieving some positive results. A recent military recruitment was made by another officer closely assisted and encouraged by Subject. The latter is now handling this new source, which could well become one of the Station's most productive.

Subject has clearly demonstrated his managerial talent and acuity in the handling of funds and other resources. I would predict a most successful tour of duty for this fine officer in Lima and foresee marked progress toward Station operational objectives as a result of his presence.

COMMENTS OF REVIERING OFFICIAL

I concur in the above ratings and comments. While it is indeed a little early to make truly valid and perceptive remarks, we have also noticed from our vantage point back here the steadying influence Mr. Keenan has exerted on two highly imaginative and active but relatively inexperienced Station members to which the COS alludes in his commentary, he too foresee a very successful tour for this talented officer and agree that the Station is indeed fortunate to have his present at this important time when operational prospects In Peru are so rapidly improving.

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

This officer has continued to give a uniformly strong or better performance during the rating period. Comments in his previous fitness report continue to apply. He has received slightly lower ratings for some specific duties in Section B only because he received a well-deserved promotion last year and now must be evaluated in comparison with other GS-14's. As can be seen from the rating, even at this new level we feel he is giving a fine performance in comparison with his new peers.

Although the Station cannot claim any breakthrough in the REDTOP field during the rating period, this officer's work continued high in quality and quantity. He added three new members to our stable of REDTOP access agents, developed an intensive target analysis program and improved our REDTOP reporting in general to the point where it has been commended by Headquarters. The most recent Hdq's evaluation stated: "The efforts against PTL Soviets show imagination and sound analysis, and reporting has improved greatly. The changes in the PTL are reasonable and the Station's support operations are well-tailored to provide information of use in programming human access to the Soviets on the PTL. Lastly, plans for the next half-year are realistic. We are encouraged by the Station's unmistakable positive attitude about the prospects of the effort against this difficult target." Working against this frustrating and difficult target, this officer has retained his (cont.)

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL I concur with the rating officer's evaluation and comment and would like to stress that the only reason his letter rating has dropped from outstanding to a solid strong is that he is now being rated as a GS-14 and not as a GS-13. A comment is also in order in regard to his possible cautiousness which is mentioned in the narrative portion of the report. Subject is a truly professional officer and especially adept at CI/FI. He is therefore able to quickly spot some weaknesses in proposed operations and quite properly and always accurately, points these out. On the other hand, in the Latin American environment some risks are acceptable which would not be tolerable in a situation where a higher degree of professionalism is mandatory. At times I have been in the anomalous position of approving an operation which Subject, perceptibly (cont)

enthusiasm, imagination and drive. He has built good photo and audio programs and a support mechanism which give us excellent coverage of the target. He has then gone further into analyses of individual targets. The groundwork has been laid methodically; what we lack is luck to recruit that most elusive of sources--a Soviet.

I have no doubt this officer has additional growth potential. He has unusual drive and motivation; he shows imagination with good judgment. He combines this with a broad background of experience in FI, CI and operational support work and excellent tradecraft. He should guard against a tendency to be over-cautious, but is intelligent, ambitious, perceptive, and has all the attributes necessary to do a good job in his next assignment as DOOS at a moderate-sized station. This will give him an opportunity to show adaptability in a major supervisory position.

This officer has high personal standards. One of his strongest characteristics is his decisiveness and ability to organize his time, recognizing priorities and accomplishing his work quickly. He never misses a deadline. His work is thorough but cuts through verbiage to the essentials. He accepts responsibility well and once an assignment is made can be depended upon to take care of it without further follow-up by the supervisor. He is mature in his attitude toward JKLANCE and both he and his family observe the highest standards of personal conduct. His wife, who is bi-lingual, adds considerably to his contact work. They are popular in the community. In sum, this employee is a proven case officer who is about to take on managerial responsibility; he has every qualification to do equally well in this field.

Continuation of Section D., Item 3. (Comments by Reviewing Official)

and correctly, has indicated as having some rather strong weaknesses. However, this comment should not be construed as indicating lack of aggressiveness in Subject. He is, in fact, very aggressive in developing operational contacts and in making recruitments. In sum, Subject is one of our best all-around officers with a great breadth of experience, a fine potential for growth, Sharp intelligence coupled with unusual discipline. We shall miss him and his wife and are certain ho will do well in his new post.

State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position.

Manner of performance of managerial & supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper. This officer continues to make an outstanding contribution to the Station. The narrative comments of the previous fitness report continue to apply to this employee who, despite the well-known frustrations of work in the REDTOP field, has maintained his drive and enthusiasm and made considerable progress in developing our REDTOP program to the point where we are promptly aware of the movements and activities of MHIHARSH personnel and now have a stable of access agents who are contributing regularly to our files of personality and vulnerability data on selected MHILARSH targets. The files which he has set up are a model of organization and thoroughness. He has drawn on all aspects of the Station's work and potential to build his program.

During the year this officer has either personally, or through his agents, recruited five new access agents. He located, staffed and organized a new observation post. He completed work on a complicated prospective audio installation which finally aborted, due to uncontrollable factors. Meanwhile he continued to improve the production of his existing agents and the organization and smooth operation of his small section. He has done a good job of guiding another officer in his first attempts at FI work. His reporting is exceptional, always timely and complete.

Of special note was the officer's progress in entertaining and developing a wide range of contacts in both the Colombian (continued)

   We call your attention to HLBT-4028, dated 25 February 1969, in which we strongly recommended that he be promoted promptly to GS-14. We reiterate this recommendation with some urgency. He will now be 40 years old in June and if we expect to keep officers of this caliber we must move them along. I am not aware that we are so rich in talent that we can afford the luxury of slighting officers who have the potential of Subject.

It is a pleasure to write a Fitness Report on this officer. Always a strong performer, Subject has continued to mature and improve during the reporting period. Early in the year he took over the Station's operational support team for several months, handling them extremely well, while developing a new team on the outside. In July he assumed primary responsibility for the Station's new REDTOP program and has done an outstanding job, of keeping abreast of REDTOP activities here and exploiting those opportunities which have occurred despite a seriously understaffed section. At the same time he is continuing to direct one outside contract agent, service an audio operation and still found time to develop another particularly important new audio operation up to its final stages of implementation. These tasks reflect the Station's confidence in and reliance on Subject who is giving an overall outstanding performance.

Subject's greatest strengths are good judgement, enthusiasim, dynamism and an ability to grasp the major elements of any task and handle them quickly and intelligently. He is personable and mixes well. During the year he has made excellent progress in expanding his contacts throughout the Colombian community and selecting and developing those that can be of use to the Station. He is aided in this by his wife who is attractive, has excellent Spanish and is a great addition to his work.

COS fully concurs with above appraisal. Subject definitely falls into the category of potential Chief of Station material. He has uncommon operational judgment, broad professional experience, a keen sense of priorities, handles people well and combines the unusual traits of being well liked yet firm. Devoted to his job he works long hours without diminishing his efficiency. Although respectful to his superiors he is decisive. An excellent family man he has no bad habits. His wife is of great assistance to him in his work. COS intends to recommend subject for promotion to GS-14 in the next cycle in the belief that men of subject's ability and potential should be brought along rapidly. He will be 39 years old next June and it is essential that he be made to feel that

Subject accepts new responsibilities readily; he shows initiative and has imagination; he displays reasonable cost-consciousness, and reacts well to supervision. Above all, Subject is energetic, recognizes priorities, and gets things done.

This man is an outstanding officer who is enthusiastic concerning WOFIRM work, and should continue to be given additional responsibilities and the grades and titles that go with such responsibilities. Director of the REDTOP program in Bogota is a major step forward, but we have just completed the preparation stage. With the success we expect him to have during the remainder of his tour, Subject should be ready to assume a position as deputy chief of an equivalent Station. At this time there are no apparent limitations to Subject's prospects. In recognition of his outstanding performance and solid potential subject is strongly recommended for early promotion from GS-13 to GS-14.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

SECTION C

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence; if required for current position. Amplify in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action.  Mention of performance of managerial or supervisory abilities and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

This employee has been at this station since June 1967 and has been assigned the following operational duties: he has started from scratch the organization of a second, unilateral surveillance team consisting of one principal agent and three foot surveillants and investigators; he is giving guidance and direction to one MOLADY contract agent who, in turn, handles Station's WOLIME program in the press and student fields; he also gives guidance and additional on-the-job training to a contract agent of Venezuelan nationality who is used in recruitment approaches, the handling of out-of-town penetrations of subversive groups, and in a support capacity.

This employee carries out the above cited tasks with initiative, alacrity and with common sense. He requires the absolute minimum of supervision. His extensive experience in his previous assignment abroad has helped greatly in getting the new surveillance and investigative team organized quickly. The direction he has given in the WOLIME field, where a reorganization was called for and is being carried out under his supervision and guidance, has been excellent, especially considering the fact that this is his first experience in the WOLIME field. The Venezuelan contract agent has carried out a number of recruitment pitches (including false flag ones) under the close supervision of this employee, who demonstrated a fine knowledge of technique and a good sense of counter intelligence procedures.

This employee is an extremely hard worker, writes well and has a well organized mind. His operational reporting is extensive and invariably on time.

BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I concur with the narrative comments and numerical ratings given by the Rating Officer. I have found this employee to be a particularly mature case officer who possesses an excellent knowledge of tradecraft and requires little or no supervision to carry out his assignments. His work is of an excellent quality and he has proved to be a definite asset to this station. His only area of weakness is that he must be more assertive and aggressive in developing operational contacts of use to the Station. This has been discussed with him and he is planning to devote more effort in the future to correct this weakness.

Annex to Pitness Report

Section C. continmed

He bas demonstrated an excellent sense of cost consciousness. This employee has a cheerful disposition and gets along well with his colleagues. His willingness to help out others certainly contributes to the smooth functioning and pleasant atmosphere at the Station. The only criticism, and a ninor one indeed, is that this employee, with the many positive assets he has (including his wife who speaks fluent Spanish), could be more forceful in the field of developing new assets of operational interest to the Station.

This officer's duties remained the same as during the rating period and he has continued to discharge with the same high degree of effectivonoss, industriousness and cheerfulness. Now that he has been under my supervision for 16 months, I find my first impressions - reflected in last year's fitness report - confirmed to the effect that subject is a strong officer possessing all the necessary qualifications for exceptional growth potential.

In dealing with Branch personnel, who often are senior to him in grade, age and experience, subject conducted himself with great tact and discretion, yet with sufficient firmness to achieve the desired results. In reviewing the FI projects of the Division he has demonstrated that he has a good sense for values, an appreciation of counter-intelligence and security factors and a proper degree of cost consciousness.

Subject did an excellent job at the staff level and has kept well on top of a very heavy paper flow. He is well-disciplined in his personal and working habits without losing his sense of humor, inquisitiveness and enthusiasm. All in all, a very fine follow to have next to you.

OFFICE OF PERSONNEL

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain rating in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory, if applicable.

While Subject has been under my supervision only for the past three months, the following comments reflect also the opinion of the previous supervisor.

HAIL ROOM

Mr. Keenan is an exceptionally strong officer. Following a successful tour in Mexico, he was assigned to the WH Division Staff in a capacity which required not only intelligence and a knowledge of operational procedures, but also a good measure of tact and perception in dealing with Branch personnel senior to him in rank and experience. Mr. Keenan adapted himself to the requirements of this assignment to our complete satisfaction.

Subject is industrious, fast in his work, and enthusiastic. Despite the inevitable demands of a large, young family, he has not permitted his domestic responsibilities to interfere with his official duties. His performance on temporary duty in the Dominican Republic merits special recognition.

The nature of a Headquarters staff assignment precludes spectacular achievements. The excitement and glamor which make field assignments challenging and rewarding are absent here. Instead, there is a routine and sometimes almost overwhelming flow of paper which has to be massaged and managed, dull as it may be. Many a young officer's motivation did not measure up to this test. Those officers who work on a desk or a staff as effectively and cheerfully as they do in the field are the ones who are likely to possess and develop the qualities needed for senior positions. Mr. Keenan is in this category. He has considerable growth potential.

Manager of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Keenan has been only a month on the job but has pitched in so vigorously that he has made a more definite impression than would ordinarily be given one in a month's time. The work here and the cases he has been dealing with are unfamiliar to him but I have found him very quick to absorb a briefing, able to ask the right and most searching questions, and fast at absorbing the key elements of a case and defining, the "problem" from reading of a case file.

He is in the process of learning his present job but he is learning quickly and I have developed a feeling of confidence in passing things to him to "look at" or to do. I have not seen enough of his writing to make a judgment of his analytical ability or of the clarity with which he can put ideas forward.

He has a good manner, is energetic, responsive, and bright, and his attitude is thoughtful and perceptive. I would assume that he would be a year or so in his present position and his assignment after that should be tied to his next overseas post. I feel he shows the qualities and interest (and has the experience from his time in Mexico) to work against our hard and serious targets: the Soviet and their collaborators of the bloc, and I suggest his future be pointed in that direction. He can learn a great deal about work against these targets in his current position.

Subject's duties and responsibilities as an Operations Officer are characterized by managerial and supervisory responsibility for several important operations. Although subject's grade (GS-10) is considerably below that of all other Station Operations Officers, it is noted that his duties, responsibilities and authority are comparable to those possessed by officers with two to four grades higher rank.

Subject is a mature, competent, conscientious and thoroughly dependable officer who always performs his assignments in an excellent manner and willingly assumes responsibilities which are usually associated with officers of higher rank.

Subject does not have any significant weaknesses. His command of the Spanish language is entirely adequate for most operational needs and is continually improving.

Based on subject's personal qualifications, his past performance and his very weighty and important operational responsibilities, it is strongly and urgently recommended that subject be promoted to at least GS-11 and that serious consideration be given to a double promotion to GS-12.

## SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicare suggestions made for of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, il appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropilate, ratings given in SECTIONS 3, C, and D to fouido a teor harla Ime dotermining future personnel actions.

Oct 25 2 32 PH '61

Subject, a Case Officer at this Station since 3 February 1960, continues his outstanding performance in assignments normally handled by a Case UIBOANE considerably higher grade.

Subject carries out his assignments with a minimum of supervision and is very willing to accept responsibilities of any type assignment to him.

Subject is rated very highly in Section B of this Fitness Report and this has been done because Subject has earned these ratings in his own right and in comparison with the work done by other Case Officers at this Station.

It is strongly recommended that Subject bo given special consideration for promotion. It would be unfortunate for KUBARK to lose a man of this calibre through neglect of his career promotions. In addition to this superior work, Subject is the head of a family of six (6). As a result of his low salary, he is relegated to an inferior standing in the local society, based upon what a man can acquire through his earnings. Subject's contacts and currently high standard operations require that he spend and appear to be making considerably more more than he is currently paid by KUBARK. It would seem unreasonable for KUBARK to expect a man of this calibre to make high level contacts and yet not be able to represent himself as a man in the economic level which his responsibilities represent.

FOREIGN LANGUAGE APTITUDE AND EXPERIENCE REPORT

The category checked below is an interpretation of the scores made by the person named above on a battery of foreign language aptitude tests. The relationships between test performance and subsequent training performance of trainees in Agency language training courses are indicated by the graphs next to the aptitude categories. The graphs to the left are for women and the graphs to the right are for men. From these graphs you can read for each aptitude category the probability that a person in that category will perform in an Agency foreign language training course at an average or better-than-average level. For example, 22 percent of the women who obtain an aptitude rating of "8" can be expected to be average or better in course performance, while 5 percent of the men with ratings of "8" can be expected to be average or better in course performance. A man needs an aptitude rating of "6" to have about the same expectation of success in language training as a woman with a rating of "8." At the other end of the scale, 80 percent of either men or women who obtain aptitude ratings of "2" can be expected to do average or better-than-average work in training. The differences in relationship are due to differences between men and women in both training performance, and test scores. On the average women are somewhat higher on both.

Since many things other than aptitudes enter into the determination of training course performance, in any class of students there will usually be some whose performance will be better than would be expected from their test scores, just as there will likely be some whose performance is poorer than expected. STRENGTH OF MOTIVATION, PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, and other factors should be considered in selecting people for language training and in interpreting language training results. For example, the number of languages previously stalled or learned and the amount of academic and nonacademic language-learning experience are factors not measured by the tests but are indicative of probable success in learning a foreign language. Whether such experience was in the same language the one to be studied or in a different one ie, of course, an additional relevant factor.

Keenan came to the Agency on the JOT Program at OS-7 on 20 May 1957. He received his B.A. in History from Marquette in 1953. He spent four years in the Navy as a Lieutenant, He was a Commo officer, having supervision of thirty men. His high motivation - he turned down an 18 month training program with IBM - coupled with his fine personal attributes, made him appear to be a good JOT candidate.

3. Formal Training

After EOD Keenan attended IOC from 27 May to 21 June 1957, receiving two Excellent evaluations. From 24 to 28 June he was on interim assignment in FBID. He attended ITC from 1 to 28 July where he earned three Excellent grades. From 28 July to 23 August he was assigned on an interim basis to WE/Spain. From 26 August to 27 September he was registered in a special TSS course. He gained good ratings. After an interim assignment to the CI Staff for one month Keenan was attached for on-the-desk training to WH/1 on 8 January 1958. In March he entered the Operations Course, where he continued until 7 June. In this course ho received four high satisfactory and two medium satis- factory grades.

4. On-the-Desk Training

On-the-desk training for Keenan in WH/1 was largely as assistant to the desk CS and FI Officer. In January 1959 he took over an Chief of the Costa Rican desk.

5. Evaluation of the Subject's Training

Keenan's evaluations in formal training have been uniformly commendatory. The ITC instructors found that "although he was a bit slow in adjusting to the requirements of the course, during the last two weeks he showed definite progress...his final briefing was excellent...pleasant young man, interested and cooperative...gives promise of being a sound intelligence officer". In the OC his work was good - "performance was highly satisfactory...in face-to-face practical exercises he was effective...acquired a highly satis- factory understanding of the various kinds of Agency operations, revealing a particularly thorough knowledge of CI concepts and methods".

On the desk he proved to be "intelligent, alert, con- scientious...enthusiastic and imaginative...gets on well with his co-workers and takes a healthy point of view toward his assignments. His motivation is high”.

6. JOTP Opinion of the subject.

Keenan has always made a good impression. He has worked diligently, has made for the smooth operation of the Program, and has received commendation from his supervisors on the dosk. It will be very surprising if Keenan does not prove to be a solid, effective officer who will make good progress in the Clandestine Services.

Mr. George Bush
Director
Central Intelligence Agency
Washington, DC 20505

Dear Mr. Bush:

I am pleased to report that Mr. Keenan, Central Intelligence Agency Civilian, was among those who successfully completed the course of Instruction at the US Army War College during Academic Year 1976 and was awarded a diploma.

This report is my evaluation of Mr. Thomas J. Keenan during his attendance at the US Army War College from 4 August 1975 to 7 June 1976. Attendance at the US Army War College is based on a highly selective process, and only a very small percentage of all those eligible is chosen. The evaluations herein are made in relation to this outstanding group of individuals. No attempt is made to distinguish between graduates on a rank order basis.

Mr. Keenan was one of eight civilians (three from the foreign affairs community) in a class of 227. This total includes 187 Army, 16 Air Force, ten Navy, and six Marine officers of colonel or lieutenant colonel or equivalent Navy rank.

In a class structure such as that outlined above, the task of the civilian student at the USAWC is an especially challenging one. Working in an area outside his normal milieu, hio was a dual responsibility. On the one hand, he had to acquaint himself in considerable detail with the military aspects of national security with which, in most instances, he has had relatively little, if any, previous experience. To accomplish this requirement, he did extensive background research in the areas of military policy, military strategy, and defense management to keep abreast of his professional military colleagues. On the other hand, his foreign policy expertise was in heavy demand by his military colleagues. In consequence, his contribution to various international relations aspects of seminar group efforts tended to be disproportionately large. Moreover, as the sole civilian voice in a seminar group of fourteen highly experienced military officers, he also ensured that adequate weight was given

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 218

Office of the Commandant
Mr. George Bush

to civilian viewpoints in the group's discussions. Much, therefore,
depended on his ability to develop rapport with his military colleagues
and on his intelligence, knowledge, skill and persuasiveness. In a very
real sense he was a teacher as well as a student.

Among the objectives of the curriculum 18 enhancing the competence of
selected officers to assume command and leadership responsibilities and
to function in key staff assignments in major Army, Joint, and combined
headquarters and in planning and policymaking positions at the seat of
government. To achieve this and related objectives, the curriculum con-
sists of three major segments: The Common Overview, the Electives. Phase,
and the Military Studies Program. The Common Overview segment includes
four courses: The United States and the World Environment, Command and
Management, Strategic Military Studies, and the Military Strategy Seminar.
In the Elective Phase, students take at least four elective courses out
of an offering of 54 courses. The large number of selections provides
an opportunity for students to tailor the curriculum to meet professional
needs. Participation in the Military Studies Program is optional and can
be substituted for one or more electives, depending on the scope of the
research subject selected. In addition, the ten-month curriculum includes
voluntary programs and field trips.

Mr. Keenan acted as assistant seminar group chairman in the core curriculum
course entitled, "The United States and the World Environment." He and
one other student edited the final seminar report, and he wrote that part
of the report dealing with US policies in the Western Hemisphere, includlag
an excellent treatment of the Panama Canal negotiations: Mr. Keenan waa
also assistant seminar group chairman during the "Strategic Military
Studies" course, and again his facile pen was put to good use on the
editorial subgroup. His calm, steadying approach to issues won the respect
of his military colleagues, and his extensive knowledge of Latin America
was particularly valuable to the group's deliberations. In the "Military
Strategy Seminar," Mr. Keenan proved himself an excellent student of
strategy and an articulate, well-prepared debater in the seminar discussions.

In the electives phase Mr. Keenan took four courses (the required number):
"The Power Potential of Developing Nations," "Contemporary Issues in US
Foreign Policy," "Strategic Issues of World War II," and "Third World:
Dynamics of Social Change"; he audited "Latin America: Power Structures
and the Current Scene." Mr. Keenan prepared carefully for his elective
courses and contributed his views in a concise, orderly manner.

Since the vast majority of the Army War College student body live together
on the post, a very important part of the overall War College experience
is the social and extracurricular interaction which takes place outside
the lecture hall and the seminar rooms. Some civilian students at the Arsy
War College need considerable time to adjust to the military subculture,
but Mr. Keenan enjoyed a relaxed camaraderie with his military colleagues.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 219

Office of the Commandant
Mr. George Bush

From the beginning. Somewhat quiet and reticent by nature, Mr. Keenan nonetheless was enthusiastic about the College's many offerings in his own low-keyed way. This soft-spoken demeanor masked a tough competitor, whether it was in seminar discussions or on the tennis courts, where he was a member of the Army War College team. Clearly, he was popular with his classmates and respected by them for his professional attainments and his personal qualities.

In the Army War College classes with which I have been personally familiar, Mr. Keenan is the first of his agency's representatives who had regional, as contrasted with functional, expertise. Mr. Keenan's thorough knowledge of Latin America made him a valued member of the class and a distinct contributor.

Mr. Keenan's demonstrated capacity to work effectively and cooperatively with officers of the military services and other civilian agencies would, I hope, be factored into the consideration of his onward assignments.

A statement specifically regarding estimated "general officer or equivalent civilian supergrade" potential has been intentionally omitted from this and all AY 76 reports. The evaluation system for USAWC students is designed principally to portray the student's aptitudes, capabilities, accomplishments, and progress within an academic environment. This does not provide an adequate basis for rendering a finite evaluation on general officer or equivalent potential, although it does not preclude making tentative judgments as to the abilities of the "whole man."

Sincerely,

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

The incumbent is a quiet, low-key, but highly energetic and competent professional officer in his chosen field. He has discharged tho responsibilities of his first more or less independent command in an outstanding way. His manner is always crisp and efficient, and as nearly as I can determine, he runs a tight ship while at the same time commanding both the affection and respect of his staff. His manner towards me has invariably been responsive and supportive. Given the inherent difficulties of the relationship, I have deliberately put pressure on him from time to time to determine his reactions. As a result, I am confident he has been fully candid with me and has shared any information which might be relative to my concerns and activities. We have been passing through a particularly difficult phase in Jamaican-US relations, in which the slightest misstep by any US Government agency, but particularly by the incumbent and his people, could have been seized upon to possibly embarrass this mission and the US Government. The incumbent has been sensitive to those dangers, has consulted with me at every turn and has taken whatever steps are possible to reduce the risk while still meeting basic requirements.

Beyond his professional specialty, the incumbent has been an important part of our Embassy family. As a member of the Country Team, he has always offered his views when asked if he folt he had a contribution to make, and I have often found them to be most helpful. He has also served as the mission's représentative on the Board of the Priory School which most mission children attend. As such, he has mado an


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 226

SECRET - ROGER CHANNEL 2

Important contribution to the morale and well-being of the Embassy family and American community. Both he and his family have invariably been forthcoming with regard to community projects, and they will be sorely missed.

I expect that the incumbent will benefit from his year at the Army War College, and anticipate that he will be ready for assignments of substantially greater responsibility thereafter. I would hope he would be given serious consideration for promotion to the next higher grade as an early opportunity. and I have little doubt that he will eventually rise to the highest professional levels of his agency. It would give me pleasure to work with him again.

Supplement to Staff Employee Personnel
Action for Integration of Thomas J. Keenan
Effective 6 January 1960

The purpose of this memorandum is to call your attention to existing policies which are particularly material to you while you are integrated and to set forth certain rights and obligations which are incident to your status as an appointed employee. It is hereby agreed and understood that:

1.  As an employee of this organization, at the present grade and salary of 08-9- $6135 per annum, you will accept cover employment with another instrumentality of the Government (hereinafter referred to as "your cover facility") effective as of 6 January 1960. You will, insofar as consistent with your basic responsibility to this organization, abide by all the rules, regulations, practices and policies of your cover facility, in order to appear as a conventional member of that establishment. Your appointment to your cover facility is being effected at F85-10 and salary of $5540 per annum. You are prohibited, except as specifically authorized herein, from retaining emoluments paid by your cover facility.

2.  It is understood and agreed that the minimum period of your overseas tour of duty is governed by and coincident with the prescribed tour of duty of your cover organization. Currently, your prescribed tour consists of a period of two (2) years from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty. Your assignment may be terminated earlier for the convenience of this organization and the length of your tour of duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organization in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour of your cover facility. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed above from the date of arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your dependents to the United States at Government expense. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed one (1) year of service from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will be required to reimburse the Goverment for all of its expenses for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependents, from the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 264

SECRET

3. Travel to your post of duty overseas and your return travel to the United States, as well as travel performed overseas which is consistent with your cover designation, will normally be at the direction of your cover facility. Such travel will be accomplished in conformance with applicable regulations of your cover facility except when you are directed for operational reasons to perform travel in accordance with the regulations of this organization.

4. Salary and (except as provided in paragraph three (3) above) allowances paid by your cover facility shall be retained by you to the extent that they are less than or equal to the salary and allowance payments due on the basis of your grade level with this organization. If such cover payments are less than the amount due, the difference will be credited to your payroll account with this organization. If such cover payments exceed the amount due, the overage will be remitted to this organization at designated intervals, presently.
   Computations hereunder will be made on the basis of the aggregate gross due and received provided, however, that in computing remittances for overage Federal and, if applicable, District of Columbia income taxes withheld by your cover facility against the overage may be deducted. To assure timely accuracy in your payroll account with this organization you are expected to immediately report cover facility payroll changes.

5. Your status as an employee of this organization will continue in full force and effect during your period of duty with your cover facility and you will continue to be entitled to all rights, benefits and emoluments of such status. Certain variations in procedure will be required, however, to preserve the security of your cover position.

a. Upon integration into your cover facility, you will continue to be covered by the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended, and at your personal expense you will be subject to payroll deductions for retirement purposes (now six and one-half percent) on the basis of your cover salary or your salary from this organization, whichever is the greater.

b. If you receive taxable income from both your cover facility and this organization, necessary adjustments for Federal, and if applicable, District of Columbia income tax purposes will be made in conformance with instructions received from this organization.

c. Consistent with your cover activity, you will continue to be responsible for compliance with the rules and regulations of this organization.

d. You are not assured upon the completion of your period of duty with your cover facility of any status with your cover based on your services performed with that organization at the request of this organization.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 265

SECRET

e. A portion of your annual and all of your sick leave which has accrued to your credit at the time of your integration shall be transferred to your cover facility. The remainder of your annual leave will be held by this organization in escrow pending the completion of your integration. If the sum of your accumulated annual leave with your cover facility and this organization exceeds the maximum accumulation entitlement afforded you under the regulations of this organization, the excess will be forfeited. If possible, such forfeiture will be accomplished by reducing the leave credit in your escrow account with this organisation. While integrated, you will be permitted annual leave, sick leave, home leave, and leave without pay in accordance with the regulations of your cover facility in lieu of the leave benefits of this organization. Upon completion of your integration, your accrued annual and sick leave will be transferred to your credit with this organization. If security conditions require that your cover facility make a lump-sum payment for accrued annual leave, you will be required to pay the gross amount thereof to this organization including income taxes withheld by your cover facility.

6. You will be required to keep forever secret this agreement and all other information which you may obtain by reason hereof, unless you are released in writing by this organization from this obligation. Violation of such secrecy may subject you to criminal prosecution under the Espionage Laws, dated 25 June 1918, as amended, and other applicable laws and regulations. The termination of your employment with this organization will not release you from the obligation of any security oath you may be required to take.

Mr. Keenan's performance in the course was highly satisfactory. His performance in Clandestine Communications, Project Management and Clandestine Services Operations were just short of excellent. In face-to-face practical exercises he was effective, and was one of the best students of the class in a ZODIAC agent-recruitment exercise. In simpler, controlled interviewing and debriefing sessions he was more effective than in exercises requiring more subtle directing and control of the agent. He developed a good understanding of field procedures, more particularly of project management, where he ranked in the upper one-third of the class. His operational reporting was better than his information reporting which was acceptable, but he made little improvement in it during the course. Mr. Keenan acquired a highly satisfactory understanding of the various kinds of Agency operations, revealing a particularly thorough knowledge of CI concepts and methods. He tied with one other student for the top grade on the CI examination.

DATES TRAINED 26 - 30 August 1957

In this course an effort was made to acquaint the student with all aspects of the subject, stressing the managerial point of view, and, at the same time, to have the student acquire an operational degree of proficiency in the three basic techniques of secret writing - liquid writing, carbon-secret writing and said development.

The broad coverage given in this course allowed little time for systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of each student. For this reason evaluations have been made only in terms of satisfactory and unsatisfactory.

The performance of Mr. Eccora was satisfactory.

Mr Keeman was a bit slow in adjusting to the requiremento of the courre, bat curing the last two weeks he showed definite progress in his grasp of the production problems. His oral presentations improved steadily, and his final briefing was excellent, both in substance and in presentation. Mr. Keenan is a very pleasant young man, interested and cooperative, and gives promise of boing a sound intelligence officer.
